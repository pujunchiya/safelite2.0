Introduction The K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary is issued in four separate documents as follows: • K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary (for Advantage Fulfillment, Advanced Fulfillment Application and Advantage Fulfillment Optimizer) • K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary (for Warehouse Advantage) • K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary (for Integrations) • K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary (for Other Modules) Note This document contains information about K.Motion Advantage Application Database tables for the Warehouse Advantage base application only. See the Körber Supply Chain customer portal for additional data dictionary documents. K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary 1 (for Warehouse Advantage) Warehouse Advantage Table Triggers The following table lists the triggers in the Warehouse Advantage application. Table/View Name Trigger Name Function t_attribute_action tr_attribute_action_update This trigger is fired before at least one of attribute_id, attribute_behavior_id, process_before, process_after and process_during is updated. The purpose of this trigger is to update the modified_date on the updated record in the table with current timestamp. t_attribute_collection_ tr_attr_collect_detail_delete This trigger is fired before a record is deleted detail from the table. The purpose of this trigger is to update the modified date on the parent record i.e., t_attribute_collection_master record corresponding to the deleted detail record with the current timestamp. t_attribute_type tr_attribute_type_insert This trigger is fired after a record is inserted to the table. The purpose of this trigger is to insert records in tables t_attribute_action and t_attribute_action_prompt corresponding to each record in t_attribute_behavior table. The inserted t_attribute_action_prompt records use the default prompt of 'Scan attribute value'. t_attribute_type tr_attribute_type_update This trigger is fired before at least one of attribute_type, description, import_validation, lookup_validation, prompt_validation and allow_mix is updated. The purpose of this trigger is to update the modified_date on the updated record in the table with current timestamp. t_attribute_collection_ tr_attr_collect_detail_change This trigger is fired before either detail sequence_id or attribute_id is updated or a new attribute_id is inserted in the table. The purpose of this trigger is to update the modified_date on the parent record i.e., t_attribute_collection_master record corresponding to the updated or inserted detail record with the current timestamp. 2 K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary (for Warehouse Advantage) Table/View Name Trigger Name Function t_item_master tr_item_master_insert This trigger is fired before a new record is inserted which has either the client code or the display_item_number as null. The purpose of this trigger is to set the client code and display item number i.e., wh_id and item_number respectively. t_item_master tr_item_master_update This trigger is fired before a record is updated for lot control, serial control, or DIA collection. The purpose of this trigger is prevent updating these controls for an item if there is inventory for it. t_order tr_order_master_insert This trigger is fired before a new record is inserted which has either the client code or the display_order_number as null. The purpose of this trigger is to set the client code and display order number i.e., wh_id and order_number respectively. t_po_master tr_po_master_insert This trigger is fired before a new record is inserted which has either the client code or the display_po_number as null. The purpose of this trigger is to set the client code and display po number, e.g., wh_id and po_number respectively. t_vas_tasks tr_t_vas_tasks_delete This trigger is fired before a record is deleted from the table. The purpose of this trigger is to delete any associated t_vas_task_image, t_vas_task_group, t_vas_task_describe, t_vas_task_pending and t_vas_task_profile_step records when a record is deleted from t_vas_tasks table if there is not work pending against it. t_vas_tasks tr_vas_task_ins This trigger is fired before a record is inserted to the table. The purpose of this trigger is to insert a unique id into the vas_task_id field. It inserts a default transaction type of 600 if one is not specified. v_rcpt_ship tr_v_rcpt_ship_ins Oracle Only. This trigger is fired when a record is inserted into the view. The purpose of this trigger is to insert the new record to the table t_rcpt_ship. v_rcpt_ship tr_v_rcpt_ship_upd Oracle Only. This trigger is fired when a record is updated in the view. The purpose of this trigger is to update the corresponding record in the table t_rcpt_ship. v_vas_profile_applies tr_v_vas_profile_applies_del This trigger is fired when a record is deleted from the view. This trigger deletes the corresponding record from the table t_vas_profile_applies. K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary 3 (for Warehouse Advantage) Table/View Name Trigger Name Function v_vas_profile_applies tr_v_vas_profile_applies_ins This trigger is fired when a record is inserted into the view. This trigger inserts the new record to the table t_vas_profile_applies. v_vas_profile_applies tr_v_vas_profile_applies_upd This trigger is fired when a record is updated in the view. This trigger updates the corresponding record in the table t_vas_profile_applies. t_whse tr_warehouse_created_insert This trigger is fired after a new warehouse record is inserted. The purpose of this trigger is to create a record in t_client when a new warehouse is created. 4 K.Motion Advantage Application Database Data Dictionary (for Warehouse Advantage) Warehouse Advantage Tables Each table in Warehouse Advantage is outlined in detail below. The column data types are different depending upon the type of database used. This difference is due to how the different databases and data types support Unicode (multi-byte) data and numbers. Notes For an Oracle database the columns that are defined in the dictionary as VARCHAR or CHAR are defined in the database as VARCHAR2 and CHAR. Oracle VARCHAR2 datatypes are defined using character length, rather than byte length [for example, VARCHAR(100 CHAR)]. VARCHAR2 datatypes can store a maximum of 4,000 bytes. In certain multi-byte languages, this means you may not be able to store the total characters defined for a field if the field allows more than 1,000 characters. For an Oracle database, the columns defined in the dictionary as INT are defined in the database as NUMBER(10). t_allocation This table stores the allocation information for picking, replenishments, planned moves.

File: Onboarding-20250210_123242-Meeting Recording-en-US.txt Technical Onboarding Documentation – Warehouse Software Support (Safelite) 1. System Architecture Overview Safelite’s supply chain ecosystem is composed of custom-built systems integrated together for Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory movement and service execution. The architecture covers: - Order Management Systems (OMS) - Sourcing and Transfer Logic - Warehouse Execution Systems (WMS) - Forecasting and Financial Systems - Real-time and batch data flow mechanisms 2. Order Lifecycle – System by System Step 1: Work Order Creation Entry Points: - safelite.com: Customer creates a service appointment (Vue.js) - SV2 (Store View 2): Store associates manually enter work orders (AngularJS) System Handling: - Orders are routed to ESL (Enterprise Service Layer), a .NET-based work order hub. - ESL acts as a transaction bus between customer interfaces and supply chain systems. Work Order Composition: - Header (metadata: customer, vehicle, location, date) - Lines (individual service components: windshield, wipers, etc.) Step 2: Work Order Routing & Validation - ESL checks for validity and forwards the WO line-level data to: - Glass Track: For sourcing and transfer evaluation 3. Sourcing and Transfer via Glass Track System Details: - Glass Track - Custom-built in .NET - Handles sourcing logic and initiates transfer requests - Contains Buyout Box: list of WOs that can’t be fulfilled internally - Interfaces with: - Korber WMS (real-time) - WTS (legacy batch WMS) Sourcing Logic: - Best-Case Workflow: 1. Glass Track queries inventory feeds from all facilities. 2. If inventory exists in a warehouse → Transfer Request created. 3. Transfer Request sent to WMS for execution. - If No Stock Exists: 1. WO line flagged for manual review (Buyout Box). 2. Human selects best vendor to buy from (manual call). 3. Appointment date updated after ETA confirmed. 4. Warehouse Management Execution WMS Options: [ {"System": "Korber", "Type": "Real-Time", "Description": "Modern system, supports immediate updates"}, {"System": "WTS", "Type": "Batch", "Description": "Legacy, nightly updates only"} ] Transfer Flow: - From Glass Track → Transfer Request (TR) → WMS (Korber/WTS) - Warehouse processes TR and creates a wave (pick list) - Items picked, packed, and shipped to store - WMS sends updates to Glass Track and ESL 5. Exception Handling – Shorts - Short = Inventory mismatch between WMS and reality - Triggered when: - Item not found - Item damaged - Bin is incorrect Short Handling Process: 1. Associate marks item short via RF gun (F7 SMT in Korber) 2. Inventory marked unavailable → triggers cycle count 3. Short info sent to Glass Track 4. Glass Track re-queues line in Buyout Box 5. New sourcing initiated (typically vendor buyout due to urgency) 6. Vendor Buyouts - Manual, high-cost fallback - Tracked in Glass Track > Vendor Tab - Associates: - Call vendors - Log delivery ETA - Adjust work order - Financial impact: ~$90 average loss per buyout 7. Forecasting & Financial Systems EBS (Oracle E-Business Suite) - Receives: - Work Orders (from ESL) - Inventory levels (from WMS) - In-flight shipments (from Korber) - Aligns: - Transfer Orders (TO) - Purchase Orders (PO) - Financial tracking GAINS (Forecasting System) - Ingests data from EBS nightly (4–5 hr batch) - Outputs: - Optimal vendor orders - Forecasted demand per warehouse - Decisions routed to Ruan (3PL logistics vendor) Vendor Planning Flow: 1. GAINS outputs suggested purchase orders 2. Human reviews/approves in EBS 3. Ruan is instructed to fulfill delivery 4. Products delivered to regional DCs and Warehouses 8.

WTS is an older system built on a PIC operating system that has been used since approximately 1991-1992. The system was originally called GTS before being redeveloped as WTS. The field primarily accesses WTS through a browser, though some personnel use a thick client. The system has both production and development environments: - Production: East Central (East Central 1 is typically the master, East Central 2 is the slave) - Development/Testing: T Central (T Central 1 is always the master, never flipped to T Central 2) ## Access Methods ### Browser Access - Users access via a URL, clicking on a "warehouse operations" icon - This launches an Accuterm terminal emulator - Users log in with a three-digit employee number and password - Alternative URL allows users to select which warehouse to access ### Thick Client Access - Some staff use an Accuterm 7 thick client - Allows command line access for advanced functions - Can run scripts and access database directly ## Visual Identification - Production screens have a dark blue and yellow color scheme - Development/testing screens use cyan or black and white ## System Architecture - Each store location has its own data siloed in the system - Individual shipment tables, purchase order tables, and inventory tables - Load balanced with 4 virtual PIC machines running on the AIG server - Master-slave configuration for redundancy ## Warehouse Identification - All locations in WTS are 5-digit numbers - System handles leading zeros automatically ## Menu System Navigation - Arrow keys navigate the main menu - Enter key selects highlighted option - Escape key backs out of menus - Numeric input + Enter can directly access menu options - Function keys provide additional shortcuts (e.g., F4, F6) ## Key Functionalities ### Shipping Management - Menu Option 1: Wholesale sales (mostly deprecated) - Intercompany transfers: Shipments to other Safelite locations - View open pending shipments - Filter by shipment number or shipping location - Warehouse-to-warehouse transfers via Glass Track - Picking orders and preparing shipments ### Inventory Management - Stocking tickets for receiving inventory - Primary bin system with overflow capability - Physical inventory menus and cycle count sheets - Inventory adjustments and scrap/blend bin management - Part information screens showing: - On-hand quantity - Reserved quantity - Quantity in picking process - Scrap/blend quantity - Available quantity - Bin location maintenance (rack, row, level format) - Inventory history tracking (up to 4 years of transactions) ### Purchase Order Management - View purchase orders from vendors or other Safelite locations - Receive inventory from vendors or other locations - Return to vendor functionality ## Data Management - ID system uses numeric identifiers (shipment numbers in 200,000-300,000 range) - Data purged after 60 days to manage storage limitations - No SQL-like transaction capabilities (no commit/rollback) - System times out after 30 minutes of inactivity ## Integration Points ### Glass Track Integration - Glass Track communicates with WTS via MQ messages - Maintains rules to determine whether to send to WTS or Corporate/Korber - Secondary warehouse processing for inventory not available at primary - XML messaging keeps inventory levels near real-time ### EBS System Integration - Nightly batch files sent to EBS, primarily closing data - EBS sends daily update files to WTS between 1:00-2:00 AM - Mainframe scheduler controls process running around 4:15 AM - Format conversion from PIC relational database to fixed-format strings ## Location Conversion Process (WTS to Corporate) - When locations convert from WTS to Corporate: - Main menu is reduced to lookup functionality only - System displays "converted to corporate" message on login - Glass Track updates routing rules to send data to Corporate instead of WTS - Only limited functions remain accessible ## Common Technical Issues - Inventory file balance problems - Users abandoning processes mid-stream causing record locks - Session timeouts causing interruptions - MQ connection issues - Network problems affecting order processing ## Warehouse Data Structure - Bins organized as rack/row/level (e.g., rack 2, bin 50, level 4) - Primary bins assigned to specific parts - Overflow bin management for additional inventory - Bin restructuring tools available for warehouse reorganization ## Security - Daily rolling password system - Combination of date/time with mathematical calculation - Different access levels for different user roles ``` { "systems": { "WTS": "Warehouse Transaction System - PIC-based point-of-sale system used since early 1990s", "Korber": "Also called 'Corporate' -

You want **only** the **technical discussions** extracted from this meeting, **remove all general chatter, jokes, or lunch planning**, and **convert**: - **Technical knowledge into detailed plain text** - **All final tables into JSON format** Here’s the extracted **Technical KT document** based on your instructions: --- # Technical Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document ## 1. Ticket Prioritization and SLAs **SLA Priorities:** - **P1 (Priority 1):** - Complete system outage (e.g., Korber, Glass Track down) - Business critical: All users impacted. - 24/7 availability required. - Even on holidays (e.g., Christmas), senior team (Alan, Eric) must respond. - Support team is not directly responsible for leading P1s but may assist. - **P2 (Priority 2):** - Intermittent outages, high latency, extreme database stress. - Borderline inoperable systems. - **P3 (Priority 3):** - Single user missing appointment today = P3. - Issues impacting a user but not business critical. - **P4 / P5 (Lower Priorities):** - Minor issues, single-user non-critical problems (e.g., missing a glass piece on a replan order). **Response Times:** | Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time | |----------|----------------|-----------------| | P1 | Immediate (24/7) | ASAP | | P2 | Immediate | ASAP | | P3 | 4 hours | 24 hours | | P4 | 4 hours | 3 days | | P5 | 4 hours | 3 days | **Reclassification:** - Tickets are often incorrectly prioritized. - Reclassification based on: - Business criticality. - Number of users impacted. **Reference Table for Prioritization:** ```json [ {"Impact": "Business Critical - All users", "Priority": "P1"}, {"Impact": "Business Critical - Multiple users", "Priority": "P2"}, {"Impact": "Business Critical - Single user", "Priority": "P3"}, {"Impact": "Not Business Critical - Single user", "Priority": "P5"} ] ``` --- ## 2. Common Ticket Types and Volumes - **Typical volume:** 100 to 130 tickets/month. - **Summer volume estimate:** 200 tickets/month. - **Historical tickets:** 90–130 monthly (last 3 months representative). **Common P3 Cases:** - Single user not able to complete order. - Appointment issues. - Latency or intermittent system issues. **Escalations:** - P1 and P2 escalation is directly handled by leads (Alan and Eric). - P3 and below: Technical support team's responsibility. --- ## 3. Tools and Access **Primary Platforms:** - **ServiceNow:** Ticket management system. - **Okta:** SSO platform for application access. - **Confluence:** Knowledge base/documentation tool. **Login Issues:** - If default password doesn’t work, call Helpdesk. - Phone password delivery only (security reason). - Username format: `firstname.lastname@safelite.com`. **Important Systems:** - **Korber:** Warehouse Management System (WMS). - **GlassTrack:** Order Management System. --- ## 4. Documentation and Process Expectations **ServiceNow Ticket Documentation Standard:** - Clear summary of the issue. - Resolution steps and actions taken. - Communication back to the user before closing. - Executive summary style notes encouraged. **Ticket Analysis Plan:** - Export last 90 days of resolved tickets. - Categorize common incidents. - Build "Top 20 Usual Suspects" list for onboarding. **Training Plan:** - Focus first on the most common 20 issues. - Documentation on standard procedures for closing each type. --- ## 5. Future Plans - **Playbook Creation:** Ongoing. First draft targeted soon but full version may not be ready before February 24. - **Support Handoff:** Ensure new hires get trained on common issues first. - **Standard Operating Procedures:** Being developed collaboratively. --- # Summary of Action Items - Export 90 days of tickets from ServiceNow. - Identify 20 most common incident types. - Create documentation for each common incident. - Build clear ticket closure standards. - Finalize team access to ServiceNow, Confluence via Okta. --- ✅ **This is a cleaned, fully technical version** ✅ **Tables are extracted into JSON wherever applicable** ✅ **Converted to Plain Text** --- Would you like me to also **package this into a .txt file** for you to download easily? 📄 (Just say yes and I'll do it!) File: Onboarding-20250211_123613-Meeting Recording-en-US.txt Here’s the **extracted and cleaned Technical KT document** from the second meeting as you instructed: - **Removed general chat, jokes, lunch, intros, etc.** - **Focused only on technical discussions** - **Final tables in JSON** --- # Technical Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document - Part 2 ## 1. Communication Process for Tickets **General Guidelines:** - **Primary Communication**: - All communication related to an incident must happen **within the incident ticket** (ServiceNow). - **Work Notes**: For internal communication (yellow notes, not visible to caller). - **Public Notes**: Visible to caller (black notes). - **Teams Communication**: - Use Teams chat **only** for technical queries *not directly related to a specific incident* (e.g., "how to access logs"). - No technical work discussions over email. Stay off email for operational work. **Best Practice Rule:** - **No communication with caller** outside the ServiceNow ticket unless absolutely necessary (and still documented inside ticket). **Ticket Note Color Codes:** ```json [ {"Color": "Black", "VisibleTo": "Caller"}, {"Color": "Yellow", "VisibleTo": "Internal Team Only"} ] ``` --- ## 2. Documentation Standards **Ticket Handling:** - Capture **Transfer Order**, **Work Order Number**, **Order IDs**, **Current Status** immediately upon ticket creation. - **Log first actions** clearly (e.g., system checks done, order statuses verified). **For System-specific Tickets:** - Different systems (Korber, GlassTrack, SV2, etc.) require **different starting information**. - Build **guides/checklists per system** to document "what information is needed." **Best Practice for Ticket Notes:** 1. Enough information to understand the ticket. 2. Current status and actions taken. 3. Categorization of system involved. 4. Root cause analysis (RCA) if available. 5. Next steps or handoff details. **RCA Documentation:** - Document RCA for **every ticket**. - Helps in building future training material and identifying common recurring issues. --- ## 3. Prioritization Process **Priority Validation:** - **Step 1**: Validate if enough information exists. - **Step 2**: Validate ticket priority (correct P1/P2/P3/etc.). **Priority Escalation Rules:** - **P2 and Above**: Immediate escalation and bridge call via OpsGenie. - **P3 and Below**: Handled by regular ticket notes and team chat. **Priority Assessment Table:** ```json [ {"Condition": "P1 or P2", "Action": "Start bridge call via OpsGenie"}, {"Condition": "P3", "Action": "Document, update in ticket, work through normal"}, {"Condition": "Priority not matching issue", "Action": "Reclassify immediately"} ] ``` --- ## 4. Ticket Handoff Between Shifts **Shift Handoff Process:** - Assign the ticket to the lead of the next shift. - Add ticket to **On Hold** status to stop SLA timer if no immediate pickup expected. - Detailed notes must be present to allow seamless pickup. **Status Codes for Handoff:** ```json [ {"Status": "On Hold", "Meaning": "Waiting for next shift"}, {"Status": "In Progress", "Meaning": "Actively being worked on"} ] ``` --- ## 5. RCA and Reporting **RCA Tracking:** - RCA to be documented for every incident. - Common RCAs will be identified and summarized monthly. **Metrics and Reporting:** - Track: - Tickets resolved. - Tickets assessed and handed off. - RCAs created. **Common Outcomes for Ticket Handling:** ```json [ {"Outcome": "Resolved - Issue Solved"}, {"Outcome": "Resolved - Not an Incident"}, {"Outcome": "Cancelled - Issue No Longer Exists"}, {"Outcome": "On Hold - Waiting Caller or Change"} ] ``` --- ## 6. System Level Ticket Routing **Procedure for Incorrect System Tickets:** - Gather as much information as possible. - Assign the ticket to the correct system support team (e.g., EBS, GlassTrack). **Example:** - Ticket missing an order: - Verify source system. - Document findings in work notes. - Assign to respective queue (e.g., EBS support). --- ## 7. SLA and OPSGenie Setup **SLA Timer:** - Putting a ticket **On Hold** stops SLA countdown. - Returning to **In Progress** resumes SLA timer. **Priority Change and OpsGenie Alerts:** - If a ticket is manually bumped from P3 to P2/P1: - Reassign to the team queue to trigger OpsGenie alert. - If not possible, manually trigger an alert in OpsGenie. **OpsGenie Paging Process:** - Manual page creation if automatic alert fails: - Select **Supply Chain Team**. - Include incident details in the alert. --- ## 8. Future Enhancements Planned - **Dashboards** for monitoring unassigned tickets from Service Desk queue. - **Proactive Identification** of stranded tickets. - **Training** of junior L1s to identify, tag, and escalate efficiently. - **Monthly RCA Trend Reporting** for management. --- ✅ **Technical content only** ✅ **General discussion, intros, jokes removed** ✅ **Tables converted into JSON where applicable** --- Would you like me to also combine **both documents** into a **single final downloadable package** (one `.txt` for KT and one `.json` for tables)? It'll be super neat if you're planning to share or upload it somewhere! 🚀 Let me know! File: Onboarding-20250212_125910-Meeting Recording-en-US.txt Here’s the **extracted and cleaned Technical KT document** from this third meeting file you uploaded: (again, keeping it in the same format: **detailed technical information only**, **no pleasantries**, and **tables in JSON**.) --- # Technical Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document - Part 3 ## 1. GlassTrack Overview **GlassTrack System Concepts:** - **Pages:** - **WTS Pages** (left side, no K1 prefix) are for Warehouse Transfer System operations. - **K1/Corporate Pages** (right side, K1 prefix) are for Korber operations. - **Supply Chain Complexity:** Two supply chains (WTS and Korber) are run **in parallel**. - **Dual Code Bases:** Separate code bases for WTS functions and Korber (K1). **Facility Selection:** - Selecting different facility IDs (e.g., Sacramento `00222`, Columbus). - Facilities determine available functionality (WTS vs. K1). --- ## 2. Buyout and Sourcing in GlassTrack **WTS Buyout Screen Features:** - Single screen for **Pending**, **Source**, and **Pending Receive**. - Allows direct sourcing from other Distribution Centers (DC) or vendors. - **Warehouse-to-Warehouse Transfers** are possible in WTS but **not in Korber**. **Sourcing Workflow:** - Select an item. - Choose distribution center or vendor. - Call vendor directly if required. - Notify GlassTrack about manual purchases. **Vendor Contact Issues:** - Some vendor phone numbers may be incorrect. - Data quality managed externally. **Warehouse-to-Warehouse Transfers:** - Available only in WTS. - Special shipment provisioned separately. **Network Classifications:** ```json [ {"Network": "In Network", "Definition": "Close geographical proximity"}, {"Network": "Out of Network", "Definition": "Farther geographical area"} ] ``` --- ## 3. Breakage and Inventory Adjustments **Breakage Handling:** - RF guns used to scan and update broken inventory. - In corporate (K1), breakage can be logged manually. --- ## 4. GlassTrack Additional Features **DC Sweep and DC One-Click:** - **DC Sweep:** Source multiple orders at once to create a single flyer. - **DC One-Click:** Legacy feature allowing faster sourcing if parts are readily available. --- ## 5. K1 (Korber) Specific Screens **Buyout Sourcing:** - Only two tabs: 1. Supporting Location 2. Vendor - No warehouse-to-warehouse transfer. - Notes on parts heavily influence sourcing decisions. **System Navigation:** - **Managed Features** section in Administration helps identify K1 vs. WTS locations. - K1 locations tagged as "HighJump" (legacy name for Korber). --- ## 6. Orders and Transfers **Transfer Orders:** - Transfers from warehouse to store. - **Status Codes:** - New: Not picked yet. - Allocated: Assigned to picker. **Reservation Requests:** - Lookup reservations against due dates. --- ## 7. Administration Section **Roles and Activities:** - **Manage Features:** Switch facilities between WTS and Korber. - **Manage Vendor Locations:** Add vendors to specific locations. - **Manage Warehouse Restrictions:** Set warehouse sourcing restrictions (WTS-specific). **Other Admin Tools:** - Auto-sourcing and Facility Imports are legacy features, not actively used. - **Helpdesk Tools:** Clearing stale appointment dates, mostly automated now. --- ## 8. System Interactions and Responsibilities **System Ownership Diagram:** - **Green Boxes:** Full supply chain system ownership. - **Blue Boxes:** Partial ownership (e.g., ESL, SV2). **GlassTrack and Korber Interaction:** - GlassTrack sends sourcing data to Korber. - Mulesoft used for middleware communication (not XML except in specific cases). **Common Troubleshooting Steps:** ```json [ {"Step": "Check GlassTrack if order is sourced properly."}, {"Step": "Check Mulesoft for transmission issues."}, {"Step": "Validate Korber for receiving issues."} ] ``` --- ## 9. Typical Incidents and Triage Process **Common Tickets:** - Short shipments not appearing in GlassTrack. - Unable to receive Purchase Orders (PO) in Korber. **Sample Triage Steps for ASN Issues:** ```json [ {"Step": "Validate ASN exists in Korber."}, {"Step": "If missing, check Mulesoft transmission."}, {"Step": "If ASN is missing, receive using PO receipt manually."} ] ``` **Required Data for Ticket Analysis:** ```json [ "Warehouse ID", "Store Number", "ASN Number", "HUID (Host Unique ID)" ] ``` **Bill of Lading (BOL) Importance:** - Requested to be attached to every ASN-related incident. --- ## 10. Ticket Handling Best Practices **Triage Documentation:** - Standardized templates under creation. - Focus on top 20 common incidents. **Investigation Process:** - Step-by-step triage flow. - Clear documentation linking symptoms, actions, systems involved, and solutions. --- ✅ **Technical and detailed** ✅ **Final tables as JSON** ✅ **General and casual chat removed** --- Would you like me to now **combine all three extracted KT documents into one final `.txt` file** and **the JSON tables separately** so you can **download everything cleanly**? (Just say yes – ready in seconds!) 📂✨ File: onboarding-20250214_093826-Meeting Recording-en-US.txt Here’s the **extracted Technical KT document** from the fourth meeting recording you uploaded: (As always: **all technical**, **removed pleasantries**, **detailed**, and **tables in JSON**.) --- # Technical Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document - Part 4 ## 1.

File: 03-04-2025_Wave I.D. shows complete but part needs to be picked.docx.docx Wave I.D. shows complete but part needs to be picked Purpose :- Wave I.D. shows complete but we still have one part that needs to be picked. in the system. Sample ticket for Reference – INC0881787 Description of ticket - Category : Software Location : Branch: MESA, AZ WH.00143 Software: KORBER Subcategory: Software behavior On our OB load I.D. 25-14-ELPA-3-3, wave I.D. 25-14-ELPA-3-3-WS, we show a DW02964 GTY part still needing to be picked. However, when we try to scan into the wave I.D., it says it is complete. This will prevent us from shipping the load virtually. Steps to follow to resolved this ticket Check Load in Korber prod Application like below Select Ware house 143 and Load id 25-14-ELPA-3-3 Check given item number in ESL data base and below result will be given Here we can see the given Item number is cancelled so user can not picked it because it already shipped Conclusion- Since the load id has been already shipped so now user can not picked it. So ticket will be resolved from our end. File: 18-03-2025_Missing PO in Koerber_Technical Documentation.docx Incident Documentation: Summary The caller reported that the PO C00221392250 was missing from Koerber after the WTS conversion. Initial Investigation : Based on the information provided by the caller. We couldn’t find anything on our side. This was the same as previous cases from 221. With the info that was provided by the caller and on the PDF file for the invoice we should have been able to localize the order on the DB Queries used for investigation: select * from t_al_host_shipment_master where order_number = 'C00221392250' select * from t_al_host_shipment_detail where order_number = 'C00221392250' select * from t_po_master where po_number = 'C00221392250' Action Taken Part 1: Gathering Information Upon confirming that the orders weren’t in Koerber. Connected with Randy Mogh via work note to ask for the details on the orders so we can create on our side manually. Info provided: WH_ID = 221 PO_NUMBER = C00221392250 VENDOR_CODE = 5114854~5114854~FREEMONT TOYOTA SHIP_FROM_NAME = FREEMONT TOYOTA SHIP_FROM_ADDR1 = 5851 Cushing Pkwy. Fremont. SHIP_FROM_ADDR2 = NULL SHIP_FROM_CITY = FREEMONT SHIP_FROM_STATE = CA SHIP_FROM_POSTAL_CODE = 94538 SHIP_FROM_COUNTRY_CODE = US WH_ID1 = 221 PO_NUMBER1 = 392250 LINE_NUMBER = 1 ITEM_NUMBER = FV25373 GTYOEM QUANTITY = 1 QTY_RECEIVED = 0 Part 2: Creating the order on Koerber CHG0057761 – Standard data change Details on how I created the script to do the insert on the last page of this doc. The insert was done at 12:10 EST on 03/18/2025. Part 3: Resubmit on K1 To make sure that the order is properly processed on Koerber, we can manually resubmit the order on K1 using the host_group_id that was created when inserting the order on the t_al_host_po_master: select * from t_al_host_po_master (nolock) where po_number = 'C00221392250' Page 29 – Inbound Order Query for the host_group_id and click resubmit. Part 4: Double Checking After the process is completed the import_satus on the t_al_host_po_master should be S and it should have an entry on the t_po_master. select * from t_al_host_po_master (nolock) where po_number = 'C00221392250' select * from t_po_master (nolock) where po_number= 'C00221392250' Resolution The order was properly placed in Koerber Script details: --Define DB USE [AAD] GO --Create the Variables so the host_group_ID and date are the same in both tables that we are inserting into DECLARE @host_group_id NVARCHAR(36) = NEWID(); DECLARE @record_create_date DATETIME = GETDATE(); --ALL the info set in here must be filled so it doesn’t give a error when resubmitting the order.

Initial Investigation Based on the information provided by the caller. We couldn’t filter out the exact data. With the location number (04279) that was provided by the caller, we were able to find information on the cancelled status. Queries used for investigation: Step 1: Verify the cancelled status in ESL_Reporting database SELECT * FROM [ESL_Reporting].[Inventory].[PurchaseOrder] po (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[PurchaseOrderDetail] pod (NOLOCK) ON pod.PurchaseOrderID = po.ID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = po.LocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] itm (NOLOCK) ON pod.PartOrderedID = itm.ID WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNumber = '409089' AND loc.LocationNumber = '04279' Status 9 means Cancelled. Step 2: Verify the cancelled status in WMS_Reporting database SELECT * FROM [WMS_Reporting].[Inventory].[TransferOrder] tom (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[TransferOrderLine] tod (NOLOCK) ON tod.TransferOrderGUID = tom.GUID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = tom.DestinationLocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] item (NOLOCK) ON item.ID = tod.ItemID WHERE tom.RetailPurchaseOrderNumber= '409089' AND loc.LocationNumber = '04279' TransferOrderStatus 5 means Cancelled. Step 3: Verify the cancelled status in Koerber database Instead of using PO number, we use Order number provided by the query in Step 2 (GT5516807) select status,*from t_order (nolock) where order_number='GT5516807' The status shows cancelled. Resolution: Since all the internal orders were cancelled across all systems so we can't open one up to receive it. One will have to manually adjust the part in. Updated the same to the caller. File: 20-03-2025_Access for Koerber - Creating K1 Users.docx Access for Koerber - Creating K1 Users Occurrence of Issue: The User wants access to Koerber for Self.

Like below File: 21-03-2025_P.O. not in system to receive.docx Technical documentation on P.O. not in system to receive / Missing PO during migration from WTS to Koerber. Occurrence of Issue: During warehouse migration some orders can be missed. So, the warehouse says they have an LP that is on hold. Incident Documentation: Summary The caller complains that a Purchase Order from a WH that was recently migrated from WTS to Koerber is missing. e.g. 00221 - Jacob Graham - P.O. not in system to receive. Hello, please help us get C00221221393723 migrated over from WTS to Koerber so we can get this part received and get the customer taken care of. Initial Investigation First, we need to confirm if it’s missing from the database or is another kind of issue. Information that we need to troubleshoot: Po number Warehouse Number Item Id and create data is a plus to double check and confirm the data If the order is missing, then we will need to manually insert the order into Koerber. If you don’t have WTS access to verify the proper shipment information, then contact someone with access. Queries used for investigation: select * from t_al_host_po_master (nolock) where po_number = 'po_number' select * from t_po_master (nolock) where po_number= 'po_number' select * from t_al_host_shipment_master where order_number = 'GT5128273' select * from t_al_host_shipment_detail where order_number = 'GT5128273' If the order is missing then we will need to manually insert the order into Koerber. Next steps: Information that we need to proceed: WH_ID,PO_NUMBER,VENDOR_CODE,SHIP_FROM_NAME,SHIP_FROM_ADDR1,SHIP_FROM_ADDR2,SHIP_FROM_CITY,SHIP_FROM_STATE,SHIP_FROM_POSTAL_CODE,SHIP_FROM_COUNTRY_CODE,WH_ID1,PO_NUMBER1,LINE_NUMBER,ITEM_NUMBER,QUANTITY,QTY_RECEIVED All the above info is what we need to set the PO properly in Koerber’s system. After getting that information you can use the Inserting PO from shipment tables script as base and create a standard change to schedule the update and record what will be done.

The Company encourages a system of progressive discipline depending on the type of prohibited conduct. However, the Company is not required to engage in progressive discipline and may discipline or terminate employees who violate the rules of conduct, or where the quality or value of their work fails to meet expectations at 11 any time. Again, any attempt at progressive discipline does not imply that your employment is anything other than on an "at- will" basis consistent with applicable law. Note that the specific terms of your employment relationship, including termination procedures, are governed by the laws of the state in which you are employed. In appropriate circumstances, management will first provide you with a verbal warning, then with one or more written warnings, and if the conduct is not sufficiently altered, eventual demotion, transfer, forced leave, or termination of employment. Your Manager will make every effort possible to allow you to respond to any disciplinary action taken. Understand that while the Company is concerned with consistent enforcement of our policies, we are not obligated to follow any disciplinary or grievance procedure and, depending on the circumstances, you may be disciplined or terminated without any prior warning or procedure. 5.3 Exit Interview You may be asked to participate in an exit interview when you leave Zania, Inc.. The purpose of the exit interview is to provide management with greater insight into your decision to leave employment; identify any trends requiring attention or opportunities for improvement; and to assist the Company in developing effective recruitment and retention strategies. Your cooperation in the exit interview process is appreciated. 5.4 Open Door/Conflict Resolution Process Zania, Inc. strives to provide a comfortable, productive, legal, and ethical work environment. To this end, we want you to bring any problems, concerns, or grievances you have about the work place to the attention of your Manager and, if necessary, to Human Resources or upper level management. To help manage conflict resolution we have instituted the following problem solving procedure: If you believe there is inappropriate conduct or activity on the part of the Company, management, its employees, vendors, customers, or any other persons or entities related to the Company, bring your concerns to the attention of your Manager at a time and place that will allow the person to properly listen to your concern. Most problems can be resolved informally through dialogue between you and your immediate Manager. If you have already brought this matter to the attention of your Manager before and do not believe you have received a sufficient response, or if you believe that person is the source of the problem, present your concerns to Human Resources or upper level management. Describe the problem, those persons involved in the problem, efforts you have made to resolve the problem, and any suggested solution you may have. 5.5 Outside Employment Outside employment that creates a conflict of interest or that affects the quality or value of your work performance or availability at Zania, Inc. is prohibited. The Company recognizes that you may seek additional employment during off hours, but in all cases expects that any outside employment will not affect your attendance, job performance, productivity, work hours, or scheduling, or would otherwise adversely affect your ability to effectively perform your duties or in any way create a conflict of interest. Any outside employment that will conflict with your duties and obligations to the Company should be reported to your Manager. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in discipline up to and including termination. 5.6 Pay Raises Depending on financial health and other Company factors, efforts will be made to give pay raises consistent with Zania, Inc. profitability, job performance, and the consumer price index.

Your initiative, effort, attitude, job knowledge, and other factors will be addressed. You must understand that a positive job performance review does not guarantee a pay raise or continued employment. Pay raises and promotions are based on numerous factors, only one of which is job performance. 5.8 Post-Employment References Zania, Inc. policy is to confirm dates of employment and job title only. With written authorization, the Company will confirm compensation information when permissible by applicable law. Forward any requests for employment verification to [[Human Resources or appropriate department]]. 5.9 Promotions To match you with the job for which you are best suited and to meet the business needs of Zania, Inc., you may be transferred from your current job.

For purposes of this policy, "solicitation" includes, but is not limited to, selling items or services, requesting contributions, and soliciting or seeking to obtain membership in or support for any organization. Solicitation performed through verbal, written, or electronic means is covered by the Nonsolicitation/Nondistribution Policy. 15 You are prohibited from soliciting other employees during your assigned working time. For this purpose, working time means time during which either you or the employees who are the object of the solicitation are expected to be actively engaged with assigned work. You may conduct solicitations during your lunch period, coffee breaks, or other authorized nonworking time, so long as you do so when the other employees are also on nonworking time. To avoid inappropriate litter, clutter, and safety risks, you may not distribute literature or other items that are not work related in working areas at any time. Working areas do not include break/rest areas, lunch rooms, or parking lots. Electronic distribution of materials is prohibited during work time. Literature that violates the company's equal employment opportunity (EEO) and nonharassment policies (including threats of violence), or is knowingly and recklessly false, is never permitted.

Fragrant products, including but not limited to perfumes, colognes, and scented body lotions or hair products, should be used in moderation out of concern for others with sensitivities or allergies. The Company, in accordance with applicable law, will reasonably accommodate employees with disabilities or religious beliefs that make it difficult for them to comply fully with the personal appearance policy unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the Company. Contact your Manager to request a reasonable accommodation. Failure to comply with the personal appearance standards may result in being sent home to groom or change clothes. Frequent violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 6.7 Personal Cell Phone/Mobile Device Use While Zania, Inc. permits employees to bring personal cell phones and other mobile devices (i.e. smart phones, tablets, laptops) into the workplace, you must not allow the use of such devices to interfere with your job duties or impact workplace safety and health. 16 Use of personal cell phones and mobile devices at work can be distracting and disruptive and cause a loss of productivity. Thus, you should primarily use such personal devices during nonworking time, such as breaks and meal periods. During this time, use devices in a manner that is courteous to those around you. Outside of nonworking time, use of such devices should be minimal and limited to emergency use only. If you have a device that has a camera and/or audio/video recording capability, you are restricted from using those functions on Company property unless authorized in advance by management or when they are used in a manner consistent with your right to engage in concerted activity under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). You are expected to comply with Company policies regarding the protection of confidential and proprietary information when using personal devices. While operating a vehicle on work time, the Company requires that the driver's personal cell phone/mobile device be turned off. If you need to make or receive a phone call while driving, pull off the road to a safe location unless you have the correct hands-free equipment for the device that is in compliance with applicable state laws. You [[may/may not]] connect your personal device to the Company network or to Company equipment (computers, printers, etc.). [[If permitted, describe allowable use and any restrictions.]] You may have the opportunity to use your personal devices for work purposes. Before using a personal device for work- related purposes, you must obtain written authorization from [[IT, management, human resources, etc.]]. The use of personal devices is limited to certain employees and may be limited based on compatibility of technology. To ensure the security of Company information, [[Set forth security policies related to specific devices, for example, any software requirements (antivirus, firewall, VPN, etc.). Include details on how information will be removed from a device upon termination of employment]]. If you are authorized to use a personal device, you will receive a monthly stipend based on the estimated use of the device. If you obtain or currently have a plan that exceeds the monthly stipend, the Company will not be liable for the cost difference. Nothing in this policy is intended to prevent employees from engaging in protected concerted activity under the NLRA. You will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for violation of this policy. 6.8 Personal Data Changes It is your obligation to provide Zania, Inc. with your current contact information, including current mailing address and telephone number. You should also inform the Company of any changes to your tax withholding status. Failure to do so may result in loss of benefits or delayed receipt of W-2 and other mailings. To make changes to this information, contact [[appropriate person or department]]. 6.9 Security All employees are responsible for helping to make Zania, Inc. a secure work environment. Upon leaving work, lock all desks, lockers, and doors protecting valuable or sensitive material in your work area and report any lost or stolen keys, passes, or similar devices to your Manager immediately. Refrain from discussing specifics regarding Company security systems, alarms, passwords, etc. with those outside of the Company. Immediately advise your Manager of any known or potential security risks and/or suspicious conduct of employees, customers, or guests of the Company. Safety and security is the responsibility of all employees and we rely on you to help us keep our premises secure. 6.10 Social Media At Zania, Inc., we recognize the Internet provides unique opportunities to participate in interactive discussions and share information using a wide variety of social media.

To minimize risks to the Company, you are expected to follow our guidelines for appropriate use of social media. This policy applies to all employees who work for the Company. Guidelines For purposes of this policy, social media includes all means of communicating or posting information or content of any sort on the Internet, including to your own or someone else's web log or blog, journal or diary, personal website, social networking or affinity website, web bulletin board or a chat room, whether associated or affiliated with the Company, as well as any other form of electronic communication.

Know and Follow the Rules Ensure your postings are consistent with these guidelines. Postings that include unlawful discriminatory remarks, harassment, and threats of violence or other unlawful conduct will not be tolerated and may subject you to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Be Respectful The Company cannot force or mandate respectful and courteous activity by employees on social media during nonworking time. If you decide to post complaints or criticism, avoid using statements, photographs, video, or audio that reasonably could be viewed as unlawful, slanderous, threatening, or that might constitute unlawful harassment. Examples of such conduct might include defamatory or slanderous posts meant to harm someone's reputation or posts that could contribute to a hostile work environment on the basis of race, sex, disability, age, national origin, religion, veteran status, or any other status or class protected by law or Company policy. Your personal posts and social media activity should not reflect upon or refer to the Company. Maintain Accuracy and Confidentiality When posting information: Maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets, intellectual property, and confidential commercially-sensitive information (i.e. financial or sales records/reports, marketing or business strategies/plans, product development, customer lists, patents, trademarks, etc.) related to the Company. Do not create a link from your personal blog, website, or other social networking site to a Company website that identifies you as speaking on behalf of the Company.

Those who retaliate against others for reporting a possible deviation from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Nothing in this policy is designed to interfere with, restrain, or prevent employees from communications regarding wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment, or to restrain employees in exercising any other right protected by law. All employees have the right to engage in or refrain from such activities. 6.11 Third Party Disclosures From time to time, Zania, Inc. may become involved in news stories or potential or actual legal proceedings of various kinds. When that happens, lawyers, former employees, newspapers, law enforcement agencies, and other outside persons may contact our employees to obtain information about the incident or the actual or potential lawsuit. If you receive such a contact, you should not speak on behalf of the Company and should refer any call requesting the position of the Company to [[media contact person]].

Policy Against Workplace Harassment Zania, Inc. has a strict policy against all types of workplace harassment, including sexual harassment and other forms of workplace harassment based upon an individual's race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists), color, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, medical condition (including cancer and genetic characteristics), genetic information, marital status, reproductive health decision-making, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender (including gender identity and gender expression), age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, veteran and/or military status, protected medical leaves (requesting or approved for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or the California Family Rights Act), domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws. This policy protects all applicants and employees (including managers and supervisors) from unlawful harassment and 31 discrimination. This includes harassment by employees, managers, supervisors, contractors, interns, volunteers, vendors, suppliers, and customers. In addition, this policy extends to conduct connected with an individual's work, even when the conduct takes place away from the workplace, such as a business trip or business-related social function. Harassment Harassment means disrespectful or unprofessional conduct, including disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on an individual's race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists), color, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, medical condition (including cancer and genetic characteristics), genetic information, marital status, reproductive health decision-making, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender (including gender identity and gender expression), age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, veteran and/or military status, protected medical leaves (requesting or approved for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or the California Family Rights Act), domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws. While it is not possible to list all the circumstances that may constitute other forms of workplace harassment, some examples of conduct that may constitute workplace harassment include: The use of disparaging or abusive words or phrases, slurs, negative stereotyping, or threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts that relate to the above-protected categories; Written or graphic material that insults, stereotypes, or shows aversion or hostility toward an individual or group because of one of the above-protected categories and that is placed on walls, bulletin boards, or elsewhere on our premises, in emails, or voicemails, or otherwise circulated in the workplace; and A display of symbols, slogans, or items that are associated with hate or intolerance toward any select group. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment means harassment based on sex or conduct of a sexual nature and includes harassment based on sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, or gender expression. It may include all of the actions described above as harassment, as well as other unwelcome sex-based conduct, such as unwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexually harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire and may include situations that began as reciprocal relationships, but that later cease to be reciprocal. Sexual harassment is generally categorized into the following two types: Quid pro quo sexual harassment ("this for that"), which includes: Submission to sexual conduct when made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment. Submission to or rejection of the conduct by an employee when used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee. Hostile work environment sexual harassment is conduct of a sexual nature or on the basis of sex by any person in the workplace that unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, or otherwise offensive working environment. Examples include: Unwelcome sexual advances, flirtation, teasing, sexually suggestive or obscene letters, invitations, notes, emails, voicemails, or gifts. Sex, gender, or sexual orientation-related comments, slurs, jokes, remarks, or epithets. Leering, obscene or vulgar gestures, or sexual gestures. Displaying or distributing sexually suggestive or derogatory objects, pictures, cartoons, or posters or any such items. Impeding or blocking movement, unwelcome touching, or assaulting others. Any sexual advances that are unwelcome as well as reprisals or threats after a negative response to sexual advances. Conduct or comments consistently targeted at one gender, even if the content is not sexual. Retaliation 32 Retaliation means any adverse employment action taken against an employee because the employee engaged in activity protected under this policy. Protected activities may include, but are not limited to, reporting or assisting in reporting suspected violations of this policy and/or cooperating in investigations or proceedings arising out of a violation of this policy. Adverse employment action is conduct or an action that materially affects the terms and conditions of the employee's employment status or is reasonably likely to deter the employee from engaging in protected activity. Even actions that do not result in a direct loss of compensation may be regarded as an adverse employment action when considered in the totality of the circumstances. Examples of retaliation under this policy include, but are not limited to: demotion, suspension, reduction in pay, denial of a merit salary increase, failure to hire or consider for hire, refusing to promote or consider for promotion because of reporting a violation of this policy, harassing another employee for filing a complaint, denying employment opportunities because of making a complaint or cooperating in an investigation, changing someone's work assignments for identifying harassment or other forms of discrimination in the workplace, treating people differently such as denying an accommodation, not talking to an employee when otherwise required by job duties, or otherwise excluding the employee from job-related activities because of engagement in activities protected under this policy. Reporting Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Retaliation If you feel that you have witnessed or have been subjected to any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, immediately notify [[name, title, phone number, email]] or any member of management. The Company prohibits retaliation against employees who, based on a reasonable belief, provide information about, complain, or assist in the investigation of any complaint of harassment or discrimination. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim and take appropriate corrective and/or remedial action where we find a claim has merit. If the Company begins an investigation, we will endeavor to conduct the investigation in a timely manner and will keep the investigation confidential to the extent possible. In the same way, anyone involved in an investigation of harassment has an obligation to keep all information about the investigation confidential. That is why the Company will only share information about a complaint of harassment with those who need to know about it. Failure to keep information about an investigation confidential may result in disciplinary action. Investigations will be documented and tracked for timely resolution. When the investigation has been completed, the Company will normally communicate the results of the investigation to the complaining individual, to the alleged harasser, and, if appropriate, to others who are directly involved. If our policy against harassment is found to have been violated, appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination, will be taken against the harasser so that further harassment will be prevented. Both the rights of the alleged harasser and the complainant will be considered in any investigation and subsequent action. Discipline for violation of this policy may include, but is not limited to, reprimand, suspension, demotion, transfer, and discharge. If the Company determines that harassment or discrimination occurred, corrective action will be taken to effectively end the harassment. As necessary, the Company may monitor any incident of harassment or discrimination to assure the inappropriate behavior has stopped. In all cases, the Company will follow up as necessary to ensure that no individual is retaliated against for making a complaint or cooperating with an investigation. In addition to our internal complaint procedure, employees may also contact either the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) to report unlawful harassment. You must file a complaint with the CRD within three years of the alleged unlawful action. The EEOC and the CRD serve as neutral factfinders and will attempt to assist the parties to voluntarily resolve their disputes. For more information, contact the Office of Human Resources or the nearest EEOC or CRD office.

All employees, unpaid interns, and volunteers may request an accommodation when their religious beliefs cause a deviation from the Company dress or grooming code, or the individual's schedule, basic job duties, or other aspects of employment. The Company will consider the request, but reserves the right to offer its own accommodation to the extent permitted by law. Some, but not all, of the factors that the Company will consider are cost, the effect that an accommodation will have on current established policies, and the burden on operations — including other employees — when determining a reasonable accommodation. At no time will the Company question the validity of a person's belief. If you require a religious accommodation, speak with your Manager [[or appropriate department]]. Wage and Hour Policies Accommodations for Nursing Mothers Zania, Inc. is required by law to provide requesting employees who are nursing mothers with certain accommodations to express milk. Accordingly, the Company will provide nursing mothers with: Reasonable break time to express milk for their infant child each time the mother has the need to express milk; and A private room or other location, other than a restroom, in close proximity to their work area that is shielded from view and free from intrusion, to express breast milk. Requesting Accommodation If you have the need for accommodation, contact your Manager. If the Company cannot provide break time or a location that complies with the above, the Company will provide you with a written response. Break Times Regarding break times, employees may use regular paid rest breaks or may take other reasonable break time when needed. If possible, the break time should run concurrently with scheduled meal and rest breaks already provided to you. If the break 34 time cannot run concurrently with meal and rest breaks already provided or additional time is needed, break times will be unpaid except where federal or state law dictates otherwise. Lactation Room or Location The provided lactation room or location will: Be safe, clean, and free of hazardous materials. Contain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items. Contain a place to sit. Have access to electricity or alternative devices, including, but not limited to, extension cords or charging stations, needed to operate an electric or battery-powered breast pump. Multipurpose rooms may be used as lactation space if they satisfy the above requirements; however, use of the room for lactation purposes must take priority over other uses. Milk Storage [[INFORM EMPLOYEES WHERE THEY MAY STORE EXPRESSED MILK: Expressed milk can be stored [in company refrigerators, refrigerators provided in the lactation room or other location]. Sufficiently mark or label your milk to avoid confusion for other employees who may share the refrigerator. If a refrigerator cannot be provided, the Company will provide another cooling device suitable for storing milk. You may also elect to bring a personal cooler for storage.]] Retaliation The Company will not retaliate against employees who request or obtain an accommodation in accordance with this policy. Right to File Complaint If you feel the Company is not providing you with adequate break time and/or a place to express milk as provided for in Labor Code § 1030, you may file a report/claim with the Labor Commissioner's Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE) at the BOFE office nearest your place of employment. The complaint must be filed within three years of the alleged unlawful action. In addition, if you believe you have been a victim of retaliation for either asserting a right to lactation accommodation or for complaining to the Labor Commissioner about the failure of the Company to provide this accommodation, you may file a retaliation claim with the Labor Commissioner's Office pursuant to Labor Code § 98.7. This claim must be filed within six months of the alleged retaliation. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be relieved of the duty to provide all or some of the above benefits if doing so would impose an undue hardship on the Company. Meal and Rest Periods Zania, Inc. strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment and comply with all federal and state regulations regarding meal and rest periods. Check with your Manager regarding procedures and schedules for meal and rest periods. The Company requests that employees observe and accurately record meal periods in time and attendance records. If you know in advance that you may not be able to take an uninterrupted scheduled meal or rest period, let your Manager know; in addition, notify your Manager as soon as possible if you were unable to take or were prohibited from taking an uninterrupted scheduled meal or rest period. Meal and rest periods are intended to provide employees with an opportunity to be away from work, and employees are not permitted to perform any work during meal and rest periods. Meal Periods If you are nonexempt and work more than five hours in a workday, you will be provided an unpaid, uninterrupted [[30- 35 minute/one-hour]] meal period no later than the end of your fifth hour of work and will be required to "clock out" from the timekeeping system. If you work fewer than six hours in a work day, you may mutually agree with your Manager to waive the meal period. If you are nonexempt and work more than 10 hours in a workday, you will be provided a second unpaid, uninterrupted [[30- minute/one-hour]] meal period no later than the end of your tenth hour of work. Depending on your occupation, if you work no more than 12 hours in a workday and have taken the first meal period, you may mutually agree with your Manager to waive the second meal period. See your Manager for procedures related to requesting to waive a meal period in the above circumstances. Rest Periods If you are nonexempt, you will also be provided paid, 10-minute rest periods based on total hours worked daily and you are not required to "clock out" from the timekeeping system. You will receive 10 minutes of uninterrupted rest time for every four hours of work, or major portion of each four hours worked. Accordingly, if you work: Less than three and a half hours, you are not entitled to a rest period. Three and a half to six hours, you are entitled to a 10-minute rest period. Six to 10 hours, you are entitled to two 10-minute rest periods. Ten to 14 hours, you are entitled to three 10-minute rest periods. Rest periods are to be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period when possible. Rest periods should not be combined or added to meal periods or used to start work later or end work early. One Day Rest in Seven In accordance with California law, nonexempt employees are generally permitted, on average, one day of rest for every seven days of work depending upon scheduling and business needs as well as availability and interest in additional hours of work. Overtime If you are nonexempt, you may qualify for overtime pay. All overtime must be approved in advance, in writing, by your Manager. At certain times Zania, Inc. may require you to work overtime. We will attempt to give as much notice as possible in this instance. However, advance notice may not always be possible. Failure to work overtime when requested or working unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If you are nonexempt and work more than eight hours in any workday or more than six days in any workweek, you will be paid overtime at a rate of: One and one-half times your regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours up to and including 12 hours in any workday, and for the first eight hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. Two times your regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 12 hours in a workday or in excess of eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. If you are nonexempt and work more than 40 hours in a workweek you may be entitled to overtime after any daily overtime hours are subtracted. The same hours are never counted against different overtime limits. Holidays, vacation days, and sick leave days do not count as time worked for computing overtime. Pay Period 36 [[Zania, Inc. pays executive, administrative, and professional employees once per month on [day of month (must be on or before the 26th day of the month)], and may be paid more frequently.]] [[Nonexempt/All employees]] are paid [[weekly/every other week/twice per month]] on [[day of week or dates of month]] for the pay period that ends on the previous [[end of pay period]]. If a payday falls on a [[weekend or]] holiday, you normally will be paid on the last business day before the [[weekend or]] holiday. If you are paid by commission, refer to your commission agreement. Review your paycheck for accuracy and report any concerns to your Manager immediately. If you have been overpaid or underpaid, the error will be corrected as soon as possible. Reporting Time Pay Zania, Inc. provides reporting time pay to nonexempt employees in all circumstances required by applicable law, including when you report to work for your scheduled shift but are asked to work, or are given, less than half of the hours you were scheduled to work. Reporting time pay may also be available for employees who are asked to call in or verify whether they will be required to work through online resources. Reporting time pay will be paid at your regular rate of pay. Reporting time pay for hours not actually worked is not counted for purposes of determining overtime. Reporting time pay is not provided under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: 1. When Company operations cannot begin or continue due to threats to employees or property, or when civil authorities recommend that work not begin or continue. 2. When public utilities fail to supply electricity, water, or gas, or there is a failure in the public utilities or sewer system. 3. When the interruption of work is caused by an "act of God" or other cause outside of the employer's control, such as an earthquake. Speak with your Manager for more information regarding reporting time pay. Travel Time Pay Some nonexempt positions within Zania, Inc. require travel. If you are nonexempt and are required to travel in the course of conducting your work, you will be paid in the following way: If you report to the workplace and then are required to travel to another site to work for the day, travel time to the assigned work place will be paid. When you are required to report to a site other than your regular work site, and you go directly to that site without first going to the regular work place, the Company will pay travel time for any time in excess of your normal commute time to the regular site. If you are required to travel to a distant work place, you will be paid travel time in addition to time worked. Your travel hours are "hours worked" for the purposes of calculating overtime. Wage Disclosure Protection In accordance with California law, Zania, Inc. will not: Prohibit you from: Disclosing your own wages; Discussing the wages of others; or Inquiring about another's wages. Require you to sign a waiver or other document that proposes to deny you the right to disclose the amount of your wages. Discharge, formally discipline, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against you for disclosing the amount of your 37 wages. However, if you have access to or knowledge of the private compensation information of other employees as a part of your role and essential job functions, you may not disclose that information to individuals who do not otherwise have access to it, unless the disclosure is: In response to a formal complaint or charge; Part of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the Company; or Consistent with the legal duty of the Company to furnish information. If you believe that you have been discriminated or retaliated against in violation of this policy, immediately report your concerns to [[appropriate person or department]]. Nothing in this policy will be enforced to interfere with, restrain or coerce, or retaliate against employees regarding their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. Workday/Workweek Zania, Inc.'s workweek runs from [[day]] to [[day]]. The workday begins at [[time]] and ends at [[time]]. Employees may be required to come in early, work late, or work overtime from time to time, depending on various factors, such as workloads, staffing needs, and special projects. [[# Alternative Workweek]] [[If certain employees have elected to work an alternative workweek, define the employee group (i.e. department) and describe the alternative schedule.]] General Policies Access to Personnel and Medical Records Files Zania, Inc. maintains separate medical records files and personnel files for all employees. Files containing medical records are stored separate and apart from any business-related records in a safe, locked, inaccessible location. The medical file is the repository for sensitive and confidential information related to an individual's health, health benefits, health-related leave and/or accommodations, and benefits selections and coverage. Medical records are kept confidential in compliance with applicable laws and access is on a "need-to-know" basis only. Supervisors and others in management may have access to your personnel file for possible employment-related decisions. All employees have the right to inspect and receive a copy of their personnel records. The Company will make such records available for inspection and/or to receive a copy within 30 calendar days of a written request. Payroll records will be made available to inspect or receive a copy within 21 calendar days of a verbal or written request. All requests by an outside party for information contained in your personnel file will be directed to the [[appropriate department]], which is the only department authorized to give out such information. Whistleblower Protections When employees notify a supervisor, manager, or an appropriate government or law enforcement agency that they have reason to believe their employer is violating a state or federal statute, or violating or not complying with a state or federal rule or regulation, those employees are protected from retaliation. As such, Zania, Inc. has a strict policy that prohibits retaliation against employees who make such reports while employed in any form of employment. The Company also does not permit retaliation against employees who refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a state or federal statute, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation. 38 If you have information regarding possible violations of state or federal statutes, rules, or regulations, or violations of fiduciary responsibility by the Company, we encourage you to report it immediately to your Manager or to the [[President/CEO]]. Alternatively, you may contact the California State Attorney General's Whistleblower Hotline at (800) 952- 5225. The Attorney General will refer your call to the appropriate government authority for review and possible investigation. Benefits Crime Victim Leave Zania, Inc. provides employees who are the victim of a violent felony or serious felony (or the family member of a victim of a violent felony or serious felony) with unpaid leave in order to attend judicial proceedings related to the crime.

When the need for leave is foreseeable, you must provide documentation of the scheduled proceeding. Such notice is typically given to the victim of the crime by a court or government agency setting the hearing, a district attorney or prosecuting attorney's office, or a victim/witness office. If advance notice is not possible, you must provide appropriate documentation within a reasonable time after the absence. Any absence from work to attend judicial proceedings will be unpaid, unless you choose to take paid time off, such as accrued vacation or personal holiday. The Company will not retaliate against employees who request or take leave in accordance with this policy. Disability Insurance If you are unable to work for at least eight days due to a non-work-related illness or injury, or a pregnancy-related disability, you may be eligible for disability insurance benefits.

Disability insurance provides eligible employees with up to 52 weeks of partial wage replacement benefits. Benefit amounts are based on a percentage of your wages paid during a specific 12- month base period, determined by the date your claim begins. To apply for this benefit, you must provide written notice of the disability, including a doctor's certificate stating the nature of the disability and your expected date of return to work.

If you are classified as exempt, you will not incur any deduction in pay for a partial week's absence due to jury duty. If you are classified as nonexempt, you will not be compensated for time spent on jury duty. You may opt to use [[PTO/vacation]] in place of unpaid leave. 39 The Company reserves the right to require employees to provide proof of jury duty service to the extent authorized by law. The Company will not retaliate against employees who request or take leave in accordance with this policy.
