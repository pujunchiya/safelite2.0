Incident Documentation: Summary The caller reported that PO 409089 shows cancelled and cannot be received in. Initial Investigation Based on the information provided by the caller. We couldn’t filter out the exact data. With the location number (04279) that was provided by the caller, we were able to find information on the cancelled status. Queries used for investigation: Step 1: Verify the cancelled status in ESL_Reporting database SELECT * FROM [ESL_Reporting].[Inventory].[PurchaseOrder] po (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[PurchaseOrderDetail] pod (NOLOCK) ON pod.PurchaseOrderID = po.ID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = po.LocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] itm (NOLOCK) ON pod.PartOrderedID = itm.ID WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNumber = '409089' AND loc.LocationNumber = '04279' Status 9 means Cancelled. Step 2: Verify the cancelled status in WMS_Reporting database SELECT * FROM [WMS_Reporting].[Inventory].[TransferOrder] tom (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[TransferOrderLine] tod (NOLOCK) ON tod.TransferOrderGUID = tom.GUID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = tom.DestinationLocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] item (NOLOCK) ON item.ID = tod.ItemID WHERE tom.RetailPurchaseOrderNumber= '409089' AND loc.LocationNumber = '04279' TransferOrderStatus 5 means Cancelled. Step 3: Verify the cancelled status in Koerber database Instead of using PO number, we use Order number provided by the query in Step 2 (GT5516807) select status,*from t_order (nolock) where order_number='GT5516807' The status shows cancelled. Resolution: Since all the internal orders were cancelled across all systems so we can't open one up to receive it. One will have to manually adjust the part in. Updated the same to the caller.

File: 26-03-2025_Change LP.docx

Technical documentation to Change LP Occurrence of Issue It occurs as per the business requirement. Changes to LP numbers are often a necessary part of maintaining an efficient and accurate supply chain. These changes help to ensure that goods are tracked correctly, that inventory is managed effectively, and that operations run smoothly. Incident Documentation Summary: The existing LP of inventory needs to be changed to a new LP. Resolution: Step 1: Create a temporary table @v_tbSto to store storage IDs. Declare variables for old license plate (W04) and new license plate (924990). declare @v_tbSto table ( sto_id bigint ) declare @v_vchOldLP nvarchar(50) = 'W04' , @v_vchNewLP nvarchar(50) = '924990' Step 2: Find all storage items in warehouse '196' that have the old license plate 'W04'. Store their IDs in the temporary table. insert into @v_tbSto (sto_id) select sto_id from t_stored_item (nolock) where hu_id = @v_vchOldLP and wh_id = '196' Step 3: These are diagnostic queries that would show: 1) The storage IDs captured in the temporary table. 2) The HU master record for the old license plate. (Currently commented out but useful for debugging) /* select * from @v_tbSto select * from t_hu_master (nolock) where hu_id = @v_vchOldLP and wh_id = '196' */ Step 4: Clear the license plate reference from all stored items that had the old license plate update sto set hu_id = null from t_stored_item sto join @v_tbSto stoh on sto.sto_id = stoh.sto_id Step 5: Change the license plate ID in the HU master table from 'W04' to '924990' for warehouse '196' update t_hu_master set hu_id = @v_vchNewLP where wh_id = '196' and hu_id = @v_vchOldLP -- Step 6: Update the stored items to reference the new license plate update sto set hu_id = @v_vchNewLP from t_stored_item sto join @v_tbSto stoh on sto.sto_id = stoh.sto_id

Introduction This runbook provides a comprehensive guide for managing incidents within the organization. It outlines the processes, roles, and responsibilities to ensure the timely and effective resolution of incidents. The goal is to minimize the impact of incidents on business operations and maintain high levels of service quality. Purpose of the Runbook The purpose of this runbook is to standardize the incident management process across the organization. By following a consistent approach, we aim to: Ensure quick identification and resolution of incidents. Reduce downtime and operational disruptions. Improve communication and coordination among teams. Enhance customer satisfaction through efficient incident handling. Scope of the Runbook This runbook applies to all types of incidents that disrupt normal operations, including: IT-related issues: Hardware failures, software bugs, network outages. Service outages: Interruptions in critical services or applications. Incident Classification An Incident refers to any unplanned event that disrupts normal operations. Incidents can vary in severity and impact, ranging from minor issues affecting a single user to critical problems impacting the entire organization. Incidents are categorized based on their urgency and impact to ensure appropriate and timely responses. Priority Levels: Priority 1 - Critical Impact: Business Critical - All Users Definition: A production system is not available; the incident disrupts an important component or a critical business process in one or more than one business unit, and the involved parties cannot work around the disruption manually. The problem has caused the work to stop immediately, which is affecting a primary business process or broad group of users, such as an entire department, floor, branch, line of business, or external customers. There is no workaround available, and the issue must be resolved immediately. Priority 2 - High Impact: Business Critical - Multiple Users – Major Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts business processes to such a great extent that it degrades a business process for multiple users or key customers. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 3 – Medium Impact: Business Critical - Single User– Moderate Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts one person, however, to such a great extent that it affects the overall organization's ability to deliver service to customers in a timely and effective way. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 4 – Low Impact: Not Business Critical - Multiple Users – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects multiple people with limited impact on a business process, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Priority 5 – Minor Impact: Not Business Critical - Single User – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects a single person with little impact on normal business processes, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Service Request Impact: Varies Definition: Service requests range from incidents that usually require attention to more day-to-day requests like changing application authorization or replacing individual records or settings. These can include process workflows that need planning by application or infrastructure support and management approval.

Introduction This runbook provides a comprehensive guide for managing incidents within the organization. It outlines the processes, roles, and responsibilities to ensure the timely and effective resolution of incidents. The goal is to minimize the impact of incidents on business operations and maintain high levels of service quality. Purpose of the Runbook The purpose of this runbook is to standardize the incident management process across the organization. By following a consistent approach, we aim to: Ensure quick identification and resolution of incidents. Reduce downtime and operational disruptions. Improve communication and coordination among teams. Enhance customer satisfaction through efficient incident handling. Scope of the Runbook This runbook applies to all types of incidents that disrupt normal operations, including: IT-related issues: Hardware failures, software bugs, network outages. Service outages: Interruptions in critical services or applications. Incident Classification An Incident refers to any unplanned event that disrupts normal operations. Incidents can vary in severity and impact, ranging from minor issues affecting a single user to critical problems impacting the entire organization. Incidents are categorized based on their urgency and impact to ensure appropriate and timely responses. Priority Levels: Priority 1 - Critical Impact: Business Critical - All Users Definition: A production system is not available; the incident disrupts an important component or a critical business process in one or more than one business unit, and the involved parties cannot work around the disruption manually. The problem has caused the work to stop immediately, which is affecting a primary business process or broad group of users, such as an entire department, floor, branch, line of business, or external customers. There is no workaround available, and the issue must be resolved immediately. Priority 2 - High Impact: Business Critical - Multiple Users – Major Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts business processes to such a great extent that it degrades a business process for multiple users or key customers. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 3 – Medium Impact: Business Critical - Single User– Moderate Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts one person, however, to such a great extent that it affects the overall organization's ability to deliver service to customers in a timely and effective way. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 4 – Low Impact: Not Business Critical - Multiple Users – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects multiple people with limited impact on a business process, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Priority 5 – Minor Impact: Not Business Critical - Single User – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects a single person with little impact on normal business processes, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Service Request Impact: Varies Definition: Service requests range from incidents that usually require attention to more day-to-day requests like changing application authorization or replacing individual records or settings. These can include process workflows that need planning by application or infrastructure support and management approval. Incident Title – ASN (Advance Shipping Notice) is on Hold Incident Summary WHS 00270 ASN# LP19600720733. When we try to scan the LP, we get an error message that says the ASN is on HOLD. We are currently unable to receive this ASN into our inventory. Incident Synopsis Incident ID: INC0872334 Brief Description of the Incident: ASN# LP19600720733 When we try to scan the LP, we get an error message that says the ASN is on HOLD. We are currently unable to receive this ASN into our inventory. Priority: P3 Date and Time of Occurrence: 03-24-2025 09:52:53 Reported By: Krish Pogue Issue Description ASN is on Hold ASN# LP19600720733. When we try to scan the LP, we get an error message that says the ASN is on HOLD. We are currently unable to receive this ASN into our inventory. Steps to Reproduce Step I: First we need to confirm if it’s missing from the data base or is another kind of issue. Information that we need to troubleshot: Po number Warehouse Number Item Id and create data is a plus to double check and confirm the data Step II: During warehouse conversions some orders can be missed. If the warehouse says they have an LP that is on hold you can insert the missing po from the al host shipment tables During warehouse conversions some orders can be missed. If the warehouse says they have an LP that is on hold you can insert the missing po from the al host shipment tables Check below data from the data table WH_ID,PO_NUMBER,VENDOR_CODE,SHIP_FROM_NAME,SHIP_FROM_ADDR1,SHIP_FROM_ADDR2,SHIP_FROM_CITY,SHIP_FROM_STATE,SHIP_FROM_POSTAL_CODE,SHIP_FROM_COUNTRY_CODE,WH_ID1,PO_NUMBER1,LINE_NUMBER,ITEM_NUMBER,QUANTITY,QTY_RECEIVED Step III: If we will move to create a SQL Script to update the data then please create a change request in system. Any changes that needs to be done on the backend is required to create a CR for it. These are the steps to create one on Service Now: Navigate to the Service Now - Belron Production Instance: Belron Production Instance Navigate to “Change” and select “Create New”. Select “Create Normal Change Click on “Save” to save the new change request and generate the change number. Fill out the new change request with the required information (continue to click save to not lose progress). Step :IV Once CR Raised create the script and update the ASN in korber by below script declare @host_group_id nvarchar(36)= newid() --INSERT INTO [dbo].[t_al_host_po_master] -- ([host_group_id] -- ,[record_create_date] -- ,[processing_code] -- ,[import_status] -- ,[error_msg] -- ,[wh_id] -- ,[client_code] -- ,[po_number] -- ,[display_po_number] -- ,[po_type] -- ,[vendor_code] -- ,[status] -- ,[ship_from_name] -- ,[ship_from_city] -- ,[ship_from_state] -- ,[ship_from_postal_code] -- ,[ship_from_country_code] --) SELECT @host_group_id ,[record_create_date] ,'New' ,NULL ,NULL ,'262' ,'262' ,[order_number] ,[display_order_number] ,'Secondary Transfers' ,'241' ,'O' ,'241 Braselton DC' ,'Braselton' ,'GA' ,'30517' ,'US' FROM [dbo].[t_al_host_shipment_master] where order_number in ('GT6418144') and status ='COMPLETE' and wh_id ='241' --INSERT INTO [dbo].[t_al_host_po_detail] -- ( -- [host_group_id] -- ,[record_create_date] -- ,[processing_code] -- ,[wh_id] -- ,[client_code] -- ,[po_number] -- ,[display_po_number] -- ,[line_number] -- ,[item_number] -- ,[display_item_number] -- ,[quantity] -- ) SELECT @host_group_id ,[record_create_date] ,'New' ,'262' ,'262' ,[order_number] ,[display_order_number] ,[line_number] ,[item_number] ,[display_item_number] ,[quantity_shipped] FROM [dbo].[t_al_host_shipment_detail] where order_number in ('GT6418144') and wh_id ='241' Add all order number in once or if want to check then add one by one like above. Setting it properly on Koerber To make sure that the order is properly processed on Koerber, we can manually resubmit the order on K1 using the host_group_id that was created when inserting the order on the t_al_host_po_master: select * from t_al_host_po_master (nolock) where po_number = 'po_number' Query for the host_group_id and click resubmit. Double Checking After the process is completed the import_satus on the t_al_host_po_master should be S and it should have an entry on the t_po_master. select * from t_al_host_po_master (nolock) where po_number = 'po_number' select * from t_po_master (nolock) where po_number= 'po_number' Update to the caller: Hi @Kris Pogue can you please check the PO is open to receive in Koerber you should be good now.

Incident Title – PO Struck in Open status Incident Summary The warehouse indicates that the order is fully shipped, but the user needs the status updated to "shipped" so he can receive and invoice the job Incident Synopsis Incident ID: INC0875382 Brief Description of the Incident: A Purchase Order (PO) has been created but remains in an open status, preventing further processing or fulfillment. Priority: P3 Date and Time of Occurrence: 3/26/2025 9:09:01 AM Reported By: Steven Mioglionico Jr Issue Description PO is in open status. PO# 388666 is currently open. However, the warehouse indicates that it has been fully shipped. The user needs the status updated to "shipped" so he can receive it and invoice the job. Steps to Reproduce Step I: Check the status in Korber. Check the status in Koerber by executing the below query: Query: - select status, *from t_order where retail_po_number='388666'; Step II: Check the TransferOrderStatus in WTS by executing the below query: SELECT LocationNumber, * FROM [WMS_Reporting].[Inventory].[TransferOrder] tom (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[TransferOrderLine] tod (NOLOCK) ON tod.TransferOrderGUID = tom.GUID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = tom.DestinationLocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] item (NOLOCK) ON item.ID = tod.ItemID WHERE tom.OrderNumber in ( 'GT6228779') Step III: Check the Status in SV2/ESL. Check the status in SV2/ESL by executing the below query: SELECT po.CreatedBy, po.ID, po.PurchaseOrderNumber, po.CreatedDate, po.ModifiedDate, po.RequestedDeliveryDate, po.Status, po.OrderDate, po.PurchaseOrderType, loc.LocationNumber, loc.SupportingLocationNumber, pod.QuantityOrdered, pod.QuantityReceived, pod.QuantityCancelledPending, pod.QuantityCancelled, pod.QuantityCancelledConfirmed, pod.LineNumber, itm.SafelitePartNumber FROM [ESL_Reporting].[Inventory].[PurchaseOrder] po (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[PurchaseOrderDetail] pod (NOLOCK) ON pod.PurchaseOrderID = po.ID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = po.LocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] itm (NOLOCK) ON pod.PartOrderedID = itm.ID WHERE loc.LocationNumber = '04003' AND po.PurchaseOrderNumber in ( '388666' ) Resolution Steps Troubleshooting Steps Reset the device and clean up the data to fix this issue. Step 1: Investigate PO Status In this case, checked PO# 388666 and found that most items had been shipped, except for order number 'GT6228779', which is still open for pickup from Koerber. Verified the status of GT6228779 in SV2 and GT and found it to be in "Open/In transit" status. Step 2: Internal Verification Conducted internal checks and confirmed that order GT6228779 is still pending shipment. Requested the caller to ship the order in the WMS to update its status. Step 3: Identify Root Cause Determined that the transfer order GT6228779 has not been shipped by the warehouse (WHS), which is preventing the ESL PO from being updated to "received" status. Update to the caller: Hey @Steven Mioglionico Jr, good morning! We've checked internally and as suggested before that order GT6228779 is still pending shipment. So requesting you to please ship the order in the WMS. The transfer order GT6228779 has not been shipped by the warehouse, which prevents us from updating the ESL PO to received status. If you have any questions, please let us know.

Introduction This runbook provides a comprehensive guide for managing incidents within the organization. It outlines the processes, roles, and responsibilities to ensure the timely and effective resolution of incidents. The goal is to minimize the impact of incidents on business operations and maintain high levels of service quality. Purpose of the Runbook The purpose of this runbook is to standardize the incident management process across the organization. By following a consistent approach, we aim to: Ensure quick identification and resolution of incidents. Reduce downtime and operational disruptions. Improve communication and coordination among teams. Enhance customer satisfaction through efficient incident handling. Scope of the Runbook This runbook applies to all types of incidents that disrupt normal operations, including: IT-related issues: Hardware failures, software bugs, network outages. Service outages: Interruptions in critical services or applications. Incident Classification An Incident refers to any unplanned event that disrupts normal operations. Incidents can vary in severity and impact, ranging from minor issues affecting a single user to critical problems impacting the entire organization. Incidents are categorized based on their urgency and impact to ensure appropriate and timely responses. Priority Levels: Priority 1 - Critical Impact: Business Critical - All Users Definition: A production system is not available; the incident disrupts an important component or a critical business process in one or more than one business unit, and the involved parties cannot work around the disruption manually. The problem has caused the work to stop immediately, which is affecting a primary business process or broad group of users, such as an entire department, floor, branch, line of business, or external customers. There is no workaround available, and the issue must be resolved immediately. Priority 2 - High Impact: Business Critical - Multiple Users – Major Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts business processes to such a great extent that it degrades a business process for multiple users or key customers. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 3 – Medium Impact: Business Critical - Single User– Moderate Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts one person, however, to such a great extent that it affects the overall organization's ability to deliver service to customers in a timely and effective way. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 4 – Low Impact: Not Business Critical - Multiple Users – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects multiple people with limited impact on a business process, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Priority 5 – Minor Impact: Not Business Critical - Single User – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects a single person with little impact on normal business processes, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Service Request Impact: Varies Definition: Service requests range from incidents that usually require attention to more day-to-day requests like changing application authorization or replacing individual records or settings. These can include process workflows that need planning by application or infrastructure support and management approval.

Check the status in Koerber by executing the below query: Step II: If Expected Data is not Provided then ask the caller to share more details as per requirement. Resolution Steps Troubleshooting Steps Reset the device and clean up the data to fix this issue. Step 1: Follow Up Hi @Aaron Galvin could you please let us know what are the parameters you are using to search that report with, date range, load id etc @Aaron Galvin what are the parameters you are using to search that report with, date range, load id? for the orders you said were missing? @Aaron Galvin what are the parameters you are using to search that report with, date range, load id? for the orders you said were missing? @Aaron Galvin- can you confirm what time the file was exported on that day and what date/times were used? If we pull it today for 4/6 it populates (looks like it was shipped 11:08pm EST) @Aaron Galvin is there a reason you use the load id to search and not just the date and ship to code? I ask because sometimes they ship loads the day before and that could be why you are not seeing some. example would be some 4/7 loads shipping on 4/6 Step 2: Analyse the Replies Hello, the doc. I uploaded has the step by step. The next day so (040725) Load Id is (S2). its not just one order, this happens to different stores. I don't close so I cant tell you what time. if I guess it would be around 11pm. I don't know why we do it like this, I was given a SOP and that's what I have used (I have only used it once). I don't upload as well, I'm just getting all the emails in the morning saying they cant see there manifest. Update to the caller: @Aaron Galvin- got cha, I understand and I will chat with Randall and Sydney to see if I can get some more clarity but I appreciate you getting this over to us! I think for now this is just a timing/what it actually being searched for so I am going to ask the IT team to close the ticket for now. Thanks for all the info!

Verified the status of GT6447903 in SV2 and GT and found it to be in "Open/In transit" status. Step 2: Internal Verification Conducted internal checks and confirmed that order GT6447903 is still pending shipment. Step 3: Identify Root Cause Determined that the transfer order GT6447903 has not been shipped by the warehouse (WHS), which is preventing the ESL PO from being updated to "received" status. Update to the caller: Hi Patricia, I see that the given order has already been shipped from Koerber, marked as completed in GlassTrack, and is currently in transit status in ESL. Do you need to process it further in order to receive it? If you're unable to receive it in SV2, could you please let us know the error you're encountering, along with a screenshot?

Incidents are categorized based on their urgency and impact to ensure appropriate and timely responses. Priority Levels: Priority 1 - Critical Impact: Business Critical - All Users Definition: A production system is not available; the incident disrupts an important component or a critical business process in one or more than one business unit, and the involved parties cannot work around the disruption manually. The problem has caused the work to stop immediately, which is affecting a primary business process or broad group of users, such as an entire department, floor, branch, line of business, or external customers. There is no workaround available, and the issue must be resolved immediately. Priority 2 - High Impact: Business Critical - Multiple Users – Major Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts business processes to such a great extent that it degrades a business process for multiple users or key customers. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 3 – Medium Impact: Business Critical - Single User– Moderate Business Impact Definition: A mission-critical application or service resource threshold is reached; the mission-critical application or service is rendered partially unusable. The incident impacts one person, however, to such a great extent that it affects the overall organization's ability to deliver service to customers in a timely and effective way. There is no workaround available, but there may be a temporary fix. Priority 4 – Low Impact: Not Business Critical - Multiple Users – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects multiple people with limited impact on a business process, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Priority 5 – Minor Impact: Not Business Critical - Single User – Minimal Business Impact Definition: The incident affects a single person with little impact on normal business processes, and the provider can handle it on a scheduled basis. There is a way to work around this problem. Service Request Impact: Varies Definition: Service requests range from incidents that usually require attention to more day-to-day requests like changing application authorization or replacing individual records or settings. These can include process workflows that need planning by application or infrastructure support and management approval. Incident Title – PO Struck Incident Summary The PO is not being processed or fulfilled, and the status remains as "open" despite the expected completion date having passed. Incident Synopsis Incident ID: INC0886144 Brief Description of the Incident: User reporting unable to receive all of parts FC shipped last night.
