File: 19-03-2025_PO shows cancelled and cannot be received.docx

Incident Documentation: Summary The caller reported that PO 409089 shows cancelled and cannot be received in. Initial Investigation Based on the information provided by the caller. We couldn’t filter out the exact data. With the location number (04279) that was provided by the caller, we were able to find information on the cancelled status. Queries used for investigation: Step 1: Verify the cancelled status in ESL_Reporting database SELECT * FROM [ESL_Reporting].[Inventory].[PurchaseOrder] po (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[PurchaseOrderDetail] pod (NOLOCK) ON pod.PurchaseOrderID = po.ID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = po.LocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] itm (NOLOCK) ON pod.PartOrderedID = itm.ID WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNumber = '409089' AND loc.LocationNumber = '04279' Status 9 means Cancelled. Step 2: Verify the cancelled status in WMS_Reporting database SELECT * FROM [WMS_Reporting].[Inventory].[TransferOrder] tom (NOLOCK) JOIN [Inventory].[TransferOrderLine] tod (NOLOCK) ON tod.TransferOrderGUID = tom.GUID JOIN [Common].[Location] loc (NOLOCK) ON loc.ID = tom.DestinationLocationID JOIN [Common].[Item] item (NOLOCK) ON item.ID = tod.ItemID WHERE tom.RetailPurchaseOrderNumber= '409089' AND loc.LocationNumber = '04279' TransferOrderStatus 5 means Cancelled. Step 3: Verify the cancelled status in Koerber database Instead of using PO number, we use Order number provided by the query in Step 2 (GT5516807) select status,*from t_order (nolock) where order_number='GT5516807' The status shows cancelled. Resolution: Since all the internal orders were cancelled across all systems so we can't open one up to receive it. One will have to manually adjust the part in. Updated the same to the caller.

Queries used for investigation: Step 1: Check the status in ‘t_order ‘ table in AAD database over Korber. select status, load_id, *from t_order where load_id='S2-3384-032125' and wh_id='140' ; Step 2: Update the status. update t_order set status='LOADED' where load_id='S2-3384-032125' and wh_id='140' Step 3: Check the status in ‘t_pick_detail ‘ table in AAD database over Korber. select *from t_pick_detail where load_id='S2-3384-032125' and wh_id='140'; Step 4: Update the status. update t_pick_detail set status='LOADED',loaded_quantity=staged_quantity where load_id='S2-3384-032125' and wh_id='140' Step 5: Check the ‘t_stored_item ‘ table in AAD database over Korber. select *from t_stored_item where type in ('11911367','11911368','11911369','11911370','11911371','11911372','11911373','11911374','11911375','11911376','11911377','11911378','11911379','11911380','11911381','11911382','11911383','11911384','11911385','11911386','11911387','11911388','11911389','11911390','11911391','11911392','11911393','11911394','11911395','11911396','11911397','11911398','11911399','11911400','11911401','11911402','11911403','11911404','11911405','11911406','11911407','11911408','11911409','11922437','11922438','11922439','11922440','11922441','11932298','11932299','11932300','11932301','11932302','11932303','11932304','11932305','11932306') and wh_id='140' Step 6: Check the ‘hu_id ‘ from t_stored_item table in AAD database over Korber. select distinct hu_id from t_stored_item where type in ('11911367','11911368','11911369','11911370','11911371','11911372','11911373','11911374','11911375','11911376','11911377','11911378','11911379','11911380','11911381','11911382','11911383','11911384','11911385','11911386','11911387','11911388','11911389','11911390','11911391','11911392','11911393','11911394','11911395','11911396','11911397','11911398','11911399','11911400','11911401','11911402','11911403','11911404','11911405','11911406','11911407','11911408','11911409','11922437','11922438','11922439','11922440','11922441','11932298','11932299','11932300','11932301','11932302','11932303','11932304','11932305','11932306') and wh_id='140' Step 7: Check the ‘hu_id ‘ from t_stored_item table in AAD database over Korber to find and match the exact record with hu master. select *from t_stored_item where hu_id in ('LP14000720470','LP14000721462','TROL140139','TROL140253','TROL140264') and wh_id='140' Step 8: Update location_id as it was partially loaded user wanted into dock door location we updated the same so that it can be shipped. update t_stored_item set location_id='DD035' where hu_id in ('LP14000720470','LP14000721462','TROL140139','TROL140253','TROL140264') and wh_id='140' Step 9: Check the ‘location_id ‘ from t_hu_master table in AAD database over Korber. select *from t_hu_master where hu_id in ('LP14000720470','LP14000721462','TROL140139','TROL140253','TROL140264') and wh_id='140' Step 8: Update location_id. update t_hu_master set location_id='DD035',type='LO' where hu_id in ('LP14000720470','LP14000721462','TROL140139','TROL140253','TROL140264') and wh_id='140' Step 9: For confirmation, please execute below queries After the load has been shipped from Koerber the t_load_master updated to shipped. select *from t_load_master where load_id='S2-3384-032125' Once the record is been shipped then we sent the shipment confirmation to upstream system and record will show on below. select *from t_al_host_shipment_master where load_id='S2-3384-032125' Resolution: We need to make sure the status should be the same in all of these mentioned tables so that user can do “begin loading” or ship from whs. Once the record has been shipped from Koerber then the inventory is updated and no records will show in ‘t_stored_item ‘ and 't_hu_master ' tables, If it is not then we have to make it first. After we need to re verify into Koerber under “Manage load ” page to know the current status and let them know to user. Incident Resolution Note: Once it is done, Inform caller .

Technical documentation to Change LP Occurrence of Issue It occurs as per the business requirement. Changes to LP numbers are often a necessary part of maintaining an efficient and accurate supply chain. These changes help to ensure that goods are tracked correctly, that inventory is managed effectively, and that operations run smoothly. Incident Documentation Summary: The existing LP of inventory needs to be changed to a new LP. Resolution: Step 1: Create a temporary table @v_tbSto to store storage IDs. Declare variables for old license plate (W04) and new license plate (924990). declare @v_tbSto table ( sto_id bigint ) declare @v_vchOldLP nvarchar(50) = 'W04' , @v_vchNewLP nvarchar(50) = '924990' Step 2: Find all storage items in warehouse '196' that have the old license plate 'W04'. Store their IDs in the temporary table. insert into @v_tbSto (sto_id) select sto_id from t_stored_item (nolock) where hu_id = @v_vchOldLP and wh_id = '196' Step 3: These are diagnostic queries that would show: 1) The storage IDs captured in the temporary table. 2) The HU master record for the old license plate. (Currently commented out but useful for debugging) /* select * from @v_tbSto select * from t_hu_master (nolock) where hu_id = @v_vchOldLP and wh_id = '196' */ Step 4: Clear the license plate reference from all stored items that had the old license plate update sto set hu_id = null from t_stored_item sto join @v_tbSto stoh on sto.sto_id = stoh.sto_id Step 5: Change the license plate ID in the HU master table from 'W04' to '924990' for warehouse '196' update t_hu_master set hu_id = @v_vchNewLP where wh_id = '196' and hu_id = @v_vchOldLP -- Step 6: Update the stored items to reference the new license plate update sto set hu_id = @v_vchNewLP from t_stored_item sto join @v_tbSto stoh on sto.sto_id = stoh.sto_id
