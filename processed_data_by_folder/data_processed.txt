You have just joined a dedicated organization. We hope that your employment with Zania, Inc. will be rewarding and challenging. We take pride in our employees as well as in the products and services we provide. The Company complies with all federal and state employment laws, and this handbook generally reflects those laws. The Company also complies with any applicable local laws, although there may not be an express written policy regarding those laws contained in the handbook. The employment policies and/or benefits summaries in this handbook are written for all employees. When questions arise concerning the interpretation of these policies as they relate to employees who are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement, the answers will be determined by reference to the actual union contract, rather than the summaries contained in this handbook. Please take the time now to read this handbook carefully. Sign the acknowledgment at the end to show that you have read, understood, and agree to the contents of this handbook, which sets out the basic rules and guidelines concerning your employment. This handbook supersedes any previously issued handbooks or policy statements dealing with the subjects discussed herein. The Company reserves the right to interpret, modify, or supplement the provisions of this handbook at any time. Neither this handbook nor any other communication by a management representative or other, whether oral or written, is intended in any way to create a contract of employment. Please understand that no employee handbook can address every situation in the work place. If you have questions about your employment or any provisions in this handbook, contact People Operations. We wish you success in your employment here at Zania, Inc.! All the best, Shruti Gupta, CEO Zania, Inc. 1.2 At-Will Employment Your employment with Zania, Inc. is on an "at-will" basis. This means your employment may be terminated at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause. Likewise, we respect your right to leave the Company at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause. Nothing in this handbook or any other Company document should be understood as creating a contract, guaranteed or continued employment, a right to termination only "for cause," or any other guarantee of continued benefits or employment. Only the CEO has the authority to make promises or negotiate with regard to guaranteed or continued employment, and any such promises are only effective if placed in writing and signed by the CEO. If a written contract between you and the Company is inconsistent with this handbook, the written contract is controlling. Nothing in this handbook will be interpreted, applied, or enforced to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. 4 This policy may not be appropriate in its entirety for employees working in Montana. 2.0 Introductory Language and Policies 2.1 About the Company [[Add your about the company statement here.]] 2.2 Company Facilities [[Insert information about your company facilities here.]] 2.3 Ethics Code Zania, Inc. will conduct business honestly and ethically wherever operations are maintained.

The confidentiality of trade secrets, proprietary information, and similar confidential commercially-sensitive information (i.e. financial or sales records/reports, marketing or business strategies/plans, product development, customer lists, patents, trademarks, etc.) about the Company or operations, or that of our customers or partners, is to be treated with discretion and only disseminated on a need-to-know basis (see policies relating to privacy). Violation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.

Nothing that occurs during or after this period should be construed to change the nature of the [["at-will"]] employment relationship. 3.7 Training Program In most cases, and for most departments, training employees is done on an individual basis by the department manager.

Travel is limited to business activities for which other means of communication is inadequate and for which prior approval from your Manager has been received.

Travel between your home and primary office is not considered to be business travel. You may not use your personal vehicle for business travel without authorization.

Failure to follow this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 5.0 Performance, Discipline, Layoff, and Termination 5.1 Criminal Activity/Arrests Zania, Inc. will report all criminal activity in accordance with applicable law. Involvement in criminal activity while employed by the Company, whether on or off Company property, may result in disciplinary action including suspension or termination of employment. You are expected to be on the job, ready to work, when scheduled. Inability to report to work as scheduled may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for violation of an attendance policy or job abandonment. 5.2 Disciplinary Process Violation of Zania, Inc.'s policies or procedures may result in disciplinary action, including demotion, transfer, leave without pay, or termination of employment. The Company encourages a system of progressive discipline depending on the type of prohibited conduct. However, the Company is not required to engage in progressive discipline and may discipline or terminate employees who violate the rules of conduct, or where the quality or value of their work fails to meet expectations at 11 any time. Again, any attempt at progressive discipline does not imply that your employment is anything other than on an "at- will" basis consistent with applicable law. Note that the specific terms of your employment relationship, including termination procedures, are governed by the laws of the state in which you are employed. In appropriate circumstances, management will first provide you with a verbal warning, then with one or more written warnings, and if the conduct is not sufficiently altered, eventual demotion, transfer, forced leave, or termination of employment. Your Manager will make every effort possible to allow you to respond to any disciplinary action taken. Understand that while the Company is concerned with consistent enforcement of our policies, we are not obligated to follow any disciplinary or grievance procedure and, depending on the circumstances, you may be disciplined or terminated without any prior warning or procedure. 5.3 Exit Interview You may be asked to participate in an exit interview when you leave Zania, Inc.. The purpose of the exit interview is to provide management with greater insight into your decision to leave employment; identify any trends requiring attention or opportunities for improvement; and to assist the Company in developing effective recruitment and retention strategies. Your cooperation in the exit interview process is appreciated. 5.4 Open Door/Conflict Resolution Process Zania, Inc. strives to provide a comfortable, productive, legal, and ethical work environment. To this end, we want you to bring any problems, concerns, or grievances you have about the work place to the attention of your Manager and, if necessary, to Human Resources or upper level management. To help manage conflict resolution we have instituted the following problem solving procedure: If you believe there is inappropriate conduct or activity on the part of the Company, management, its employees, vendors, customers, or any other persons or entities related to the Company, bring your concerns to the attention of your Manager at a time and place that will allow the person to properly listen to your concern. Most problems can be resolved informally through dialogue between you and your immediate Manager. If you have already brought this matter to the attention of your Manager before and do not believe you have received a sufficient response, or if you believe that person is the source of the problem, present your concerns to Human Resources or upper level management. Describe the problem, those persons involved in the problem, efforts you have made to resolve the problem, and any suggested solution you may have. 5.5 Outside Employment Outside employment that creates a conflict of interest or that affects the quality or value of your work performance or availability at Zania, Inc. is prohibited. The Company recognizes that you may seek additional employment during off hours, but in all cases expects that any outside employment will not affect your attendance, job performance, productivity, work hours, or scheduling, or would otherwise adversely affect your ability to effectively perform your duties or in any way create a conflict of interest. Any outside employment that will conflict with your duties and obligations to the Company should be reported to your Manager. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in discipline up to and including termination. 5.6 Pay Raises Depending on financial health and other Company factors, efforts will be made to give pay raises consistent with Zania, Inc. profitability, job performance, and the consumer price index. The Company may also make individual pay raises based on merit or due to a change of job position. 5.7 Performance Improvement Zania, Inc. will make efforts to periodically review your work performance. The performance improvement process will take place [[annually, biannually, monthly, etc.]], or as business needs dictate. You may specifically request that your Manager assist you in developing a performance improvement plan at any time. 12 The performance improvement process is a means for increasing the quality and value of your work performance. Your initiative, effort, attitude, job knowledge, and other factors will be addressed. You must understand that a positive job performance review does not guarantee a pay raise or continued employment. Pay raises and promotions are based on numerous factors, only one of which is job performance. 5.8 Post-Employment References Zania, Inc. policy is to confirm dates of employment and job title only. With written authorization, the Company will confirm compensation information when permissible by applicable law. Forward any requests for employment verification to [[Human Resources or appropriate department]]. 5.9 Promotions To match you with the job for which you are best suited and to meet the business needs of Zania, Inc., you may be transferred from your current job. It is our policy to promote from within only when the most qualified candidate is available. Promotions are made on an equal opportunity basis according to employees possessing the needed skills, education, experience, and other qualifications that are required for the job. [[Optional: All employees promoted into new job positions will undergo an introductory period as described in the New Hires and Introductory Periods policy. Unlike new hires, however, such employees will continue to receive Company benefits for which they are eligible.]] 5.10 Resignation Policy Zania, Inc. hopes that your employment with the Company will be a mutually rewarding experience; however, the Company acknowledges that varying circumstances can cause you to resign employment.

Notice The Company requests that you provide a minimum of [[two weeks']] notice of your resignation. [[If you are a Manager, you are requested to provide a minimum of [four weeks'] notice.]] Provide a written resignation letter to your Manager. If you provide less notice than requested, the Company may deem you to be ineligible for rehire, depending on the circumstances of the notice given. The Company reserves the right to provide you with pay in lieu of notice in situations where job or business needs warrant. Final Pay The Company will pay separated employees in accordance with applicable laws and other sections of this handbook. Notify the Company if your address changes during the calendar year in which resignation occurs to ensure tax information is sent to the correct address. Return of Property Return all Company property at the time of separation, including [[list items to be returned, such as uniforms, cellphones, keys, tools, laptops, credit cards, and identification cards]]. Failure to return some items may result in deductions from your final paycheck where state law allows. [[In some circumstances, the Company may pursue criminal charges for failure to return Company property.]] 5.11 Standards of Conduct Zania, Inc. wishes to create a work environment that promotes job satisfaction, respect, responsibility, integrity, and value for all our employees, clients, customers, and other stakeholders.

Any exceptions to this policy must be in writing and signed by a Manager prior to the event. Alcoholic beverages may be available at these events.

Instead, please call a taxi or appoint a designated driver. 6.3 Employer-Provided Cell Phones/Mobile Devices Zania, Inc. may issue certain employees a Company cell phone/mobile device for work-related communications and/or operations. If you drive a vehicle during your employment, you may not use any cell phone/mobile device or other communication device while driving unless the device is equipped or configured with a "hands-free" listening/speaking option, and you in fact utilize the hands-free device. [[We understand that you may use the cell phone/mobile device for personal use; however, such personal use should not exceed the plan allowance. When the cell phone/mobile device is used for personal reasons and the activity results in additional cost to the Company, you are responsible for the cost of that usage, including all applicable taxes unless prohibited by law.]] The Company owns and remains entitled to all cell phone/mobile devices issued to employees, including all passwords controlling access to them. You may not change those passwords except with permission. At the time of employment termination, all such equipment and passwords must be returned to the Company in operable condition. Violation of this policy may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. 6.4 Nonsolicitation/Nondistribution Policy To avoid disruption of business operations or disturbance of employees, visitors, and others, Zania, Inc. has implemented a Nonsolicitation/Nondistribution Policy. For purposes of this policy, "solicitation" includes, but is not limited to, selling items or services, requesting contributions, and soliciting or seeking to obtain membership in or support for any organization. Solicitation performed through verbal, written, or electronic means is covered by the Nonsolicitation/Nondistribution Policy. 15 You are prohibited from soliciting other employees during your assigned working time. For this purpose, working time means time during which either you or the employees who are the object of the solicitation are expected to be actively engaged with assigned work. You may conduct solicitations during your lunch period, coffee breaks, or other authorized nonworking time, so long as you do so when the other employees are also on nonworking time. To avoid inappropriate litter, clutter, and safety risks, you may not distribute literature or other items that are not work related in working areas at any time. Working areas do not include break/rest areas, lunch rooms, or parking lots. Electronic distribution of materials is prohibited during work time. Literature that violates the company's equal employment opportunity (EEO) and nonharassment policies (including threats of violence), or is knowingly and recklessly false, is never permitted. Non-employees are not permitted to distribute materials on company premises at any time. This policy is not intended to restrict the statutory rights of employees, including the right to discuss terms and conditions of employment. Violations of this policy should be reported to your Manager. 6.5 Off-Duty Use of Employer Property or Premises You may not use Zania, Inc. property for personal use during working time. You are responsible for returning Company property in good condition and repairing or replacing any property damaged as the result of personal use or as the result of negligence. This includes use of copy machines, computers, Company products, or office supplies for personal use without prior authorization. It is Company policy to control off duty and nonworking hour use of Company facilities either for business or personal reasons. You are prohibited from using Company facilities during off duty or nonworking hours without the written consent of your Manager. If you use Company facilities during your off-duty hours or Company off-hours, you may be required to sign a log-in and log-out sheet maintained by the Company or building manager. 6.6 Personal Appearance Your personal appearance reflects on the reputation, integrity, and public image of Zania, Inc.. All employees are required to report to work neatly groomed and dressed. You are expected to maintain personal hygiene habits that are generally accepted in the community, including clean clothing, good grooming and personal hygiene, and appropriate attire for the workplace and the work being performed. This may include wearing uniforms or protective safety clothing and equipment, depending upon the job. Use common sense and good judgment in determining what to wear to work. Fragrant products, including but not limited to perfumes, colognes, and scented body lotions or hair products, should be used in moderation out of concern for others with sensitivities or allergies. The Company, in accordance with applicable law, will reasonably accommodate employees with disabilities or religious beliefs that make it difficult for them to comply fully with the personal appearance policy unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the Company. Contact your Manager to request a reasonable accommodation. Failure to comply with the personal appearance standards may result in being sent home to groom or change clothes. Frequent violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 6.7 Personal Cell Phone/Mobile Device Use While Zania, Inc. permits employees to bring personal cell phones and other mobile devices (i.e. smart phones, tablets, laptops) into the workplace, you must not allow the use of such devices to interfere with your job duties or impact workplace safety and health. 16 Use of personal cell phones and mobile devices at work can be distracting and disruptive and cause a loss of productivity. Thus, you should primarily use such personal devices during nonworking time, such as breaks and meal periods. During this time, use devices in a manner that is courteous to those around you. Outside of nonworking time, use of such devices should be minimal and limited to emergency use only. If you have a device that has a camera and/or audio/video recording capability, you are restricted from using those functions on Company property unless authorized in advance by management or when they are used in a manner consistent with your right to engage in concerted activity under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). You are expected to comply with Company policies regarding the protection of confidential and proprietary information when using personal devices. While operating a vehicle on work time, the Company requires that the driver's personal cell phone/mobile device be turned off. If you need to make or receive a phone call while driving, pull off the road to a safe location unless you have the correct hands-free equipment for the device that is in compliance with applicable state laws. You [[may/may not]] connect your personal device to the Company network or to Company equipment (computers, printers, etc.). [[If permitted, describe allowable use and any restrictions.]] You may have the opportunity to use your personal devices for work purposes. Before using a personal device for work- related purposes, you must obtain written authorization from [[IT, management, human resources, etc.]]. The use of personal devices is limited to certain employees and may be limited based on compatibility of technology. To ensure the security of Company information, [[Set forth security policies related to specific devices, for example, any software requirements (antivirus, firewall, VPN, etc.). Include details on how information will be removed from a device upon termination of employment]]. If you are authorized to use a personal device, you will receive a monthly stipend based on the estimated use of the device. If you obtain or currently have a plan that exceeds the monthly stipend, the Company will not be liable for the cost difference. Nothing in this policy is intended to prevent employees from engaging in protected concerted activity under the NLRA. You will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for violation of this policy. 6.8 Personal Data Changes It is your obligation to provide Zania, Inc. with your current contact information, including current mailing address and telephone number. You should also inform the Company of any changes to your tax withholding status. Failure to do so may result in loss of benefits or delayed receipt of W-2 and other mailings. To make changes to this information, contact [[appropriate person or department]]. 6.9 Security All employees are responsible for helping to make Zania, Inc. a secure work environment. Upon leaving work, lock all desks, lockers, and doors protecting valuable or sensitive material in your work area and report any lost or stolen keys, passes, or similar devices to your Manager immediately. Refrain from discussing specifics regarding Company security systems, alarms, passwords, etc. with those outside of the Company. Immediately advise your Manager of any known or potential security risks and/or suspicious conduct of employees, customers, or guests of the Company. Safety and security is the responsibility of all employees and we rely on you to help us keep our premises secure. 6.10 Social Media At Zania, Inc., we recognize the Internet provides unique opportunities to participate in interactive discussions and share information using a wide variety of social media.

Know and Follow the Rules Ensure your postings are consistent with these guidelines. Postings that include unlawful discriminatory remarks, harassment, and threats of violence or other unlawful conduct will not be tolerated and may subject you to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Be Respectful The Company cannot force or mandate respectful and courteous activity by employees on social media during nonworking time. If you decide to post complaints or criticism, avoid using statements, photographs, video, or audio that reasonably could be viewed as unlawful, slanderous, threatening, or that might constitute unlawful harassment. Examples of such conduct might include defamatory or slanderous posts meant to harm someone's reputation or posts that could contribute to a hostile work environment on the basis of race, sex, disability, age, national origin, religion, veteran status, or any other status or class protected by law or Company policy. Your personal posts and social media activity should not reflect upon or refer to the Company. Maintain Accuracy and Confidentiality When posting information: Maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets, intellectual property, and confidential commercially-sensitive information (i.e. financial or sales records/reports, marketing or business strategies/plans, product development, customer lists, patents, trademarks, etc.) related to the Company. Do not create a link from your personal blog, website, or other social networking site to a Company website that identifies you as speaking on behalf of the Company.

Make it clear in your social media activity that you are speaking on your own behalf. Respect copyright, trademark, third-party rights, and similar laws and use such protected information in compliance with applicable legal standards. Using Social Media at Work Do not use social media while on your work time, unless it is work related as authorized by your manager or consistent with policies that cover equipment owned by the Company.

Those who retaliate against others for reporting a possible deviation from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Nothing in this policy is designed to interfere with, restrain, or prevent employees from communications regarding wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment, or to restrain employees in exercising any other right protected by law. All employees have the right to engage in or refrain from such activities. 6.11 Third Party Disclosures From time to time, Zania, Inc. may become involved in news stories or potential or actual legal proceedings of various kinds. When that happens, lawyers, former employees, newspapers, law enforcement agencies, and other outside persons may contact our employees to obtain information about the incident or the actual or potential lawsuit. If you receive such a contact, you should not speak on behalf of the Company and should refer any call requesting the position of the Company to [[media contact person]]. If you have any questions about this policy or are not certain what to do when such a contact is made, contact [[media contact person]]. 6.12 Use of Company Technology This policy is intended to provide Zania, Inc. employees with the guidelines associated with the use of the Company information technology (IT) resources and communications systems.

Policy Against Workplace Harassment Zania, Inc. has a strict policy against all types of workplace harassment, including sexual harassment and other forms of workplace harassment based upon an individual's race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists), color, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, medical condition (including cancer and genetic characteristics), genetic information, marital status, reproductive health decision-making, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender (including gender identity and gender expression), age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, veteran and/or military status, protected medical leaves (requesting or approved for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or the California Family Rights Act), domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws. This policy protects all applicants and employees (including managers and supervisors) from unlawful harassment and 31 discrimination. This includes harassment by employees, managers, supervisors, contractors, interns, volunteers, vendors, suppliers, and customers. In addition, this policy extends to conduct connected with an individual's work, even when the conduct takes place away from the workplace, such as a business trip or business-related social function.

Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment means harassment based on sex or conduct of a sexual nature and includes harassment based on sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, or gender expression. It may include all of the actions described above as harassment, as well as other unwelcome sex-based conduct, such as unwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexually harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire and may include situations that began as reciprocal relationships, but that later cease to be reciprocal. Sexual harassment is generally categorized into the following two types: Quid pro quo sexual harassment ("this for that"), which includes: Submission to sexual conduct when made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment. Submission to or rejection of the conduct by an employee when used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee. Hostile work environment sexual harassment is conduct of a sexual nature or on the basis of sex by any person in the workplace that unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, or otherwise offensive working environment. Examples include: Unwelcome sexual advances, flirtation, teasing, sexually suggestive or obscene letters, invitations, notes, emails, voicemails, or gifts. Sex, gender, or sexual orientation-related comments, slurs, jokes, remarks, or epithets. Leering, obscene or vulgar gestures, or sexual gestures.

Retaliation 32 Retaliation means any adverse employment action taken against an employee because the employee engaged in activity protected under this policy. Protected activities may include, but are not limited to, reporting or assisting in reporting suspected violations of this policy and/or cooperating in investigations or proceedings arising out of a violation of this policy. Adverse employment action is conduct or an action that materially affects the terms and conditions of the employee's employment status or is reasonably likely to deter the employee from engaging in protected activity. Even actions that do not result in a direct loss of compensation may be regarded as an adverse employment action when considered in the totality of the circumstances. Examples of retaliation under this policy include, but are not limited to: demotion, suspension, reduction in pay, denial of a merit salary increase, failure to hire or consider for hire, refusing to promote or consider for promotion because of reporting a violation of this policy, harassing another employee for filing a complaint, denying employment opportunities because of making a complaint or cooperating in an investigation, changing someone's work assignments for identifying harassment or other forms of discrimination in the workplace, treating people differently such as denying an accommodation, not talking to an employee when otherwise required by job duties, or otherwise excluding the employee from job-related activities because of engagement in activities protected under this policy. Reporting Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Retaliation If you feel that you have witnessed or have been subjected to any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, immediately notify [[name, title, phone number, email]] or any member of management. The Company prohibits retaliation against employees who, based on a reasonable belief, provide information about, complain, or assist in the investigation of any complaint of harassment or discrimination. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim and take appropriate corrective and/or remedial action where we find a claim has merit. If the Company begins an investigation, we will endeavor to conduct the investigation in a timely manner and will keep the investigation confidential to the extent possible. In the same way, anyone involved in an investigation of harassment has an obligation to keep all information about the investigation confidential. That is why the Company will only share information about a complaint of harassment with those who need to know about it. Failure to keep information about an investigation confidential may result in disciplinary action. Investigations will be documented and tracked for timely resolution. When the investigation has been completed, the Company will normally communicate the results of the investigation to the complaining individual, to the alleged harasser, and, if appropriate, to others who are directly involved. If our policy against harassment is found to have been violated, appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination, will be taken against the harasser so that further harassment will be prevented. Both the rights of the alleged harasser and the complainant will be considered in any investigation and subsequent action. Discipline for violation of this policy may include, but is not limited to, reprimand, suspension, demotion, transfer, and discharge. If the Company determines that harassment or discrimination occurred, corrective action will be taken to effectively end the harassment. As necessary, the Company may monitor any incident of harassment or discrimination to assure the inappropriate behavior has stopped. In all cases, the Company will follow up as necessary to ensure that no individual is retaliated against for making a complaint or cooperating with an investigation. In addition to our internal complaint procedure, employees may also contact either the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) to report unlawful harassment. You must file a complaint with the CRD within three years of the alleged unlawful action. The EEOC and the CRD serve as neutral factfinders and will attempt to assist the parties to voluntarily resolve their disputes. For more information, contact the Office of Human Resources or the nearest EEOC or CRD office.

All employees, unpaid interns, and volunteers may request an accommodation when their religious beliefs cause a deviation from the Company dress or grooming code, or the individual's schedule, basic job duties, or other aspects of employment. The Company will consider the request, but reserves the right to offer its own accommodation to the extent permitted by law. Some, but not all, of the factors that the Company will consider are cost, the effect that an accommodation will have on current established policies, and the burden on operations — including other employees — when determining a reasonable accommodation. At no time will the Company question the validity of a person's belief. If you require a religious accommodation, speak with your Manager [[or appropriate department]]. Wage and Hour Policies Accommodations for Nursing Mothers Zania, Inc. is required by law to provide requesting employees who are nursing mothers with certain accommodations to express milk. Accordingly, the Company will provide nursing mothers with: Reasonable break time to express milk for their infant child each time the mother has the need to express milk; and A private room or other location, other than a restroom, in close proximity to their work area that is shielded from view and free from intrusion, to express breast milk. Requesting Accommodation If you have the need for accommodation, contact your Manager. If the Company cannot provide break time or a location that complies with the above, the Company will provide you with a written response. Break Times Regarding break times, employees may use regular paid rest breaks or may take other reasonable break time when needed. If possible, the break time should run concurrently with scheduled meal and rest breaks already provided to you. If the break 34 time cannot run concurrently with meal and rest breaks already provided or additional time is needed, break times will be unpaid except where federal or state law dictates otherwise. Lactation Room or Location The provided lactation room or location will: Be safe, clean, and free of hazardous materials. Contain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items. Contain a place to sit. Have access to electricity or alternative devices, including, but not limited to, extension cords or charging stations, needed to operate an electric or battery-powered breast pump.

Milk Storage [[INFORM EMPLOYEES WHERE THEY MAY STORE EXPRESSED MILK: Expressed milk can be stored [in company refrigerators, refrigerators provided in the lactation room or other location]. Sufficiently mark or label your milk to avoid confusion for other employees who may share the refrigerator. If a refrigerator cannot be provided, the Company will provide another cooling device suitable for storing milk. You may also elect to bring a personal cooler for storage.]] Retaliation The Company will not retaliate against employees who request or obtain an accommodation in accordance with this policy. Right to File Complaint If you feel the Company is not providing you with adequate break time and/or a place to express milk as provided for in Labor Code § 1030, you may file a report/claim with the Labor Commissioner's Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE) at the BOFE office nearest your place of employment. The complaint must be filed within three years of the alleged unlawful action. In addition, if you believe you have been a victim of retaliation for either asserting a right to lactation accommodation or for complaining to the Labor Commissioner about the failure of the Company to provide this accommodation, you may file a retaliation claim with the Labor Commissioner's Office pursuant to Labor Code § 98.7. This claim must be filed within six months of the alleged retaliation. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be relieved of the duty to provide all or some of the above benefits if doing so would impose an undue hardship on the Company. Meal and Rest Periods Zania, Inc. strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment and comply with all federal and state regulations regarding meal and rest periods. Check with your Manager regarding procedures and schedules for meal and rest periods. The Company requests that employees observe and accurately record meal periods in time and attendance records. If you know in advance that you may not be able to take an uninterrupted scheduled meal or rest period, let your Manager know; in addition, notify your Manager as soon as possible if you were unable to take or were prohibited from taking an uninterrupted scheduled meal or rest period. Meal and rest periods are intended to provide employees with an opportunity to be away from work, and employees are not permitted to perform any work during meal and rest periods. Meal Periods If you are nonexempt and work more than five hours in a workday, you will be provided an unpaid, uninterrupted [[30- 35 minute/one-hour]] meal period no later than the end of your fifth hour of work and will be required to "clock out" from the timekeeping system. If you work fewer than six hours in a work day, you may mutually agree with your Manager to waive the meal period. If you are nonexempt and work more than 10 hours in a workday, you will be provided a second unpaid, uninterrupted [[30- minute/one-hour]] meal period no later than the end of your tenth hour of work. Depending on your occupation, if you work no more than 12 hours in a workday and have taken the first meal period, you may mutually agree with your Manager to waive the second meal period. See your Manager for procedures related to requesting to waive a meal period in the above circumstances. Rest Periods If you are nonexempt, you will also be provided paid, 10-minute rest periods based on total hours worked daily and you are not required to "clock out" from the timekeeping system. You will receive 10 minutes of uninterrupted rest time for every four hours of work, or major portion of each four hours worked. Accordingly, if you work: Less than three and a half hours, you are not entitled to a rest period. Three and a half to six hours, you are entitled to a 10-minute rest period. Six to 10 hours, you are entitled to two 10-minute rest periods. Ten to 14 hours, you are entitled to three 10-minute rest periods. Rest periods are to be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period when possible. Rest periods should not be combined or added to meal periods or used to start work later or end work early. One Day Rest in Seven In accordance with California law, nonexempt employees are generally permitted, on average, one day of rest for every seven days of work depending upon scheduling and business needs as well as availability and interest in additional hours of work. Overtime If you are nonexempt, you may qualify for overtime pay. All overtime must be approved in advance, in writing, by your Manager. At certain times Zania, Inc. may require you to work overtime. We will attempt to give as much notice as possible in this instance. However, advance notice may not always be possible. Failure to work overtime when requested or working unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If you are nonexempt and work more than eight hours in any workday or more than six days in any workweek, you will be paid overtime at a rate of: One and one-half times your regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours up to and including 12 hours in any workday, and for the first eight hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. Two times your regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 12 hours in a workday or in excess of eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. If you are nonexempt and work more than 40 hours in a workweek you may be entitled to overtime after any daily overtime hours are subtracted. The same hours are never counted against different overtime limits. Holidays, vacation days, and sick leave days do not count as time worked for computing overtime. Pay Period 36 [[Zania, Inc. pays executive, administrative, and professional employees once per month on [day of month (must be on or before the 26th day of the month)], and may be paid more frequently.]] [[Nonexempt/All employees]] are paid [[weekly/every other week/twice per month]] on [[day of week or dates of month]] for the pay period that ends on the previous [[end of pay period]]. If a payday falls on a [[weekend or]] holiday, you normally will be paid on the last business day before the [[weekend or]] holiday. If you are paid by commission, refer to your commission agreement. Review your paycheck for accuracy and report any concerns to your Manager immediately. If you have been overpaid or underpaid, the error will be corrected as soon as possible. Reporting Time Pay Zania, Inc. provides reporting time pay to nonexempt employees in all circumstances required by applicable law, including when you report to work for your scheduled shift but are asked to work, or are given, less than half of the hours you were scheduled to work. Reporting time pay may also be available for employees who are asked to call in or verify whether they will be required to work through online resources. Reporting time pay will be paid at your regular rate of pay. Reporting time pay for hours not actually worked is not counted for purposes of determining overtime. Reporting time pay is not provided under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: 1. When Company operations cannot begin or continue due to threats to employees or property, or when civil authorities recommend that work not begin or continue. 2. When public utilities fail to supply electricity, water, or gas, or there is a failure in the public utilities or sewer system. 3. When the interruption of work is caused by an "act of God" or other cause outside of the employer's control, such as an earthquake. Speak with your Manager for more information regarding reporting time pay. Travel Time Pay Some nonexempt positions within Zania, Inc. require travel. If you are nonexempt and are required to travel in the course of conducting your work, you will be paid in the following way: If you report to the workplace and then are required to travel to another site to work for the day, travel time to the assigned work place will be paid. When you are required to report to a site other than your regular work site, and you go directly to that site without first going to the regular work place, the Company will pay travel time for any time in excess of your normal commute time to the regular site. If you are required to travel to a distant work place, you will be paid travel time in addition to time worked. Your travel hours are "hours worked" for the purposes of calculating overtime. Wage Disclosure Protection In accordance with California law, Zania, Inc. will not: Prohibit you from: Disclosing your own wages; Discussing the wages of others; or Inquiring about another's wages. Require you to sign a waiver or other document that proposes to deny you the right to disclose the amount of your wages. Discharge, formally discipline, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against you for disclosing the amount of your 37 wages. However, if you have access to or knowledge of the private compensation information of other employees as a part of your role and essential job functions, you may not disclose that information to individuals who do not otherwise have access to it, unless the disclosure is: In response to a formal complaint or charge; Part of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the Company; or Consistent with the legal duty of the Company to furnish information. If you believe that you have been discriminated or retaliated against in violation of this policy, immediately report your concerns to [[appropriate person or department]]. Nothing in this policy will be enforced to interfere with, restrain or coerce, or retaliate against employees regarding their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. Workday/Workweek Zania, Inc.'s workweek runs from [[day]] to [[day]]. The workday begins at [[time]] and ends at [[time]]. Employees may be required to come in early, work late, or work overtime from time to time, depending on various factors, such as workloads, staffing needs, and special projects. [[# Alternative Workweek]] [[If certain employees have elected to work an alternative workweek, define the employee group (i.e. department) and describe the alternative schedule.]] General Policies Access to Personnel and Medical Records Files Zania, Inc. maintains separate medical records files and personnel files for all employees. Files containing medical records are stored separate and apart from any business-related records in a safe, locked, inaccessible location. The medical file is the repository for sensitive and confidential information related to an individual's health, health benefits, health-related leave and/or accommodations, and benefits selections and coverage. Medical records are kept confidential in compliance with applicable laws and access is on a "need-to-know" basis only. Supervisors and others in management may have access to your personnel file for possible employment-related decisions. All employees have the right to inspect and receive a copy of their personnel records. The Company will make such records available for inspection and/or to receive a copy within 30 calendar days of a written request. Payroll records will be made available to inspect or receive a copy within 21 calendar days of a verbal or written request. All requests by an outside party for information contained in your personnel file will be directed to the [[appropriate department]], which is the only department authorized to give out such information. Whistleblower Protections When employees notify a supervisor, manager, or an appropriate government or law enforcement agency that they have reason to believe their employer is violating a state or federal statute, or violating or not complying with a state or federal rule or regulation, those employees are protected from retaliation. As such, Zania, Inc. has a strict policy that prohibits retaliation against employees who make such reports while employed in any form of employment. The Company also does not permit retaliation against employees who refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a state or federal statute, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation. 38 If you have information regarding possible violations of state or federal statutes, rules, or regulations, or violations of fiduciary responsibility by the Company, we encourage you to report it immediately to your Manager or to the [[President/CEO]]. Alternatively, you may contact the California State Attorney General's Whistleblower Hotline at (800) 952- 5225. The Attorney General will refer your call to the appropriate government authority for review and possible investigation.

Disability Insurance If you are unable to work for at least eight days due to a non-work-related illness or injury, or a pregnancy-related disability, you may be eligible for disability insurance benefits. Disability insurance is a component of California's State Disability Insurance (SDI) program, which is administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and is funded by workers through SDI payroll deductions. Disability insurance provides eligible employees with up to 52 weeks of partial wage replacement benefits. Benefit amounts are based on a percentage of your wages paid during a specific 12- month base period, determined by the date your claim begins. To apply for this benefit, you must provide written notice of the disability, including a doctor's certificate stating the nature of the disability and your expected date of return to work. The SDI program does not create a right to a leave of absence, job protection, or job reinstatement. You are responsible for filing your claim and other forms promptly and accurately with the EDD. To learn more about the SDI program, including eligibility requirements and benefits, or to make a claim for DI benefits, contact the EDD (www.edd.ca.gov). Zania, Inc. will be notified that you have submitted a disability insurance claim. Jury Duty Leave Zania, Inc. encourages employees to fulfill their civic duties related to jury duty. If you are summoned for jury duty, notify your Manager as soon as possible to make scheduling arrangements. If you are classified as exempt, you will not incur any deduction in pay for a partial week's absence due to jury duty. If you are classified as nonexempt, you will not be compensated for time spent on jury duty. You may opt to use [[PTO/vacation]] in place of unpaid leave. 39 The Company reserves the right to require employees to provide proof of jury duty service to the extent authorized by law. The Company will not retaliate against employees who request or take leave in accordance with this policy.
