Technical Onboarding Documentation – Warehouse Software Support (Safelite)

1. System Architecture Overview
Safelite’s supply chain ecosystem is composed of custom-built systems integrated together for Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory movement and service execution. The architecture covers:
- Order Management Systems (OMS)
- Sourcing and Transfer Logic
- Warehouse Execution Systems (WMS)
- Forecasting and Financial Systems
- Real-time and batch data flow mechanisms

2. Order Lifecycle – System by System

Step 1: Work Order Creation
Entry Points:
- safelite.com: Customer creates a service appointment (Vue.js)
- SV2 (Store View 2): Store associates manually enter work orders (AngularJS)

System Handling:
- Orders are routed to ESL (Enterprise Service Layer), a .NET-based work order hub.
- ESL acts as a transaction bus between customer interfaces and supply chain systems.

Work Order Composition:
- Header (metadata: customer, vehicle, location, date)
- Lines (individual service components: windshield, wipers, etc.)

Step 2: Work Order Routing & Validation
- ESL checks for validity and forwards the WO line-level data to:
  - Glass Track: For sourcing and transfer evaluation

3. Sourcing and Transfer via Glass Track

System Details:
- Glass Track
  - Custom-built in .NET
  - Handles sourcing logic and initiates transfer requests
  - Contains Buyout Box: list of WOs that can’t be fulfilled internally
  - Interfaces with:
    - Korber WMS (real-time)
    - WTS (legacy batch WMS)

Sourcing Logic:
- Best-Case Workflow:
  1. Glass Track queries inventory feeds from all facilities.
  2. If inventory exists in a warehouse → Transfer Request created.
  3. Transfer Request sent to WMS for execution.

- If No Stock Exists:
  1. WO line flagged for manual review (Buyout Box).
  2. Human selects best vendor to buy from (manual call).
  3. Appointment date updated after ETA confirmed.

4. Warehouse Management Execution

WMS Options:
[
  {"System": "Korber", "Type": "Real-Time", "Description": "Modern system, supports immediate updates"},
  {"System": "WTS", "Type": "Batch", "Description": "Legacy, nightly updates only"}
]

Transfer Flow:
- From Glass Track → Transfer Request (TR) → WMS (Korber/WTS)
- Warehouse processes TR and creates a wave (pick list)
- Items picked, packed, and shipped to store
- WMS sends updates to Glass Track and ESL

5. Exception Handling – Shorts

- Short = Inventory mismatch between WMS and reality
- Triggered when:
  - Item not found
  - Item damaged
  - Bin is incorrect

Short Handling Process:
1. Associate marks item short via RF gun (F7 SMT in Korber)
2. Inventory marked unavailable → triggers cycle count
3. Short info sent to Glass Track
4. Glass Track re-queues line in Buyout Box
5. New sourcing initiated (typically vendor buyout due to urgency)

6. Vendor Buyouts

- Manual, high-cost fallback
- Tracked in Glass Track > Vendor Tab
- Associates:
  - Call vendors
  - Log delivery ETA
  - Adjust work order
- Financial impact: ~$90 average loss per buyout

7. Forecasting & Financial Systems

EBS (Oracle E-Business Suite)
- Receives:
  - Work Orders (from ESL)
  - Inventory levels (from WMS)
  - In-flight shipments (from Korber)
- Aligns:
  - Transfer Orders (TO)
  - Purchase Orders (PO)
  - Financial tracking

GAINS (Forecasting System)
- Ingests data from EBS nightly (4–5 hr batch)
- Outputs:
  - Optimal vendor orders
  - Forecasted demand per warehouse
- Decisions routed to Ruan (3PL logistics vendor)

Vendor Planning Flow:
1. GAINS outputs suggested purchase orders
2. Human reviews/approves in EBS
3. Ruan is instructed to fulfill delivery
4. Products delivered to regional DCs and Warehouses
