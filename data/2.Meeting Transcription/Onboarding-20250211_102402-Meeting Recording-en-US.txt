# Technical Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document

## 1. Ticket Prioritization and SLAs

**SLA Priorities:**

- **P1 (Priority 1):**  
  - Complete system outage (e.g., Korber, Glass Track down)  
  - Business critical: All users impacted.
  - 24/7 availability required.
  - Even on holidays (e.g., Christmas), senior team (Alan, Eric) must respond.
  - Support team is not directly responsible for leading P1s but may assist.

- **P2 (Priority 2):**  
  - Intermittent outages, high latency, extreme database stress.  
  - Borderline inoperable systems.

- **P3 (Priority 3):**  
  - Single user missing appointment today = P3.
  - Issues impacting a user but not business critical.

- **P4 / P5 (Lower Priorities):**  
  - Minor issues, single-user non-critical problems (e.g., missing a glass piece on a replan order).

**Response Times:**

| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| P1       | Immediate (24/7) | ASAP            |
| P2       | Immediate       | ASAP            |
| P3       | 4 hours         | 24 hours        |
| P4       | 4 hours         | 3 days          |
| P5       | 4 hours         | 3 days          |

**Reclassification:**  
- Tickets are often incorrectly prioritized.  
- Reclassification based on:
  - Business criticality.
  - Number of users impacted.

**Reference Table for Prioritization:**

```json
[
  {"Impact": "Business Critical - All users", "Priority": "P1"},
  {"Impact": "Business Critical - Multiple users", "Priority": "P2"},
  {"Impact": "Business Critical - Single user", "Priority": "P3"},
  {"Impact": "Not Business Critical - Single user", "Priority": "P5"}
]
```
