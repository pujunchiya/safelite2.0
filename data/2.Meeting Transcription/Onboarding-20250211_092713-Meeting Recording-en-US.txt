# WTS and Corporate Warehouse Systems Technical Knowledge Transfer

## System Overview

WTS (Warehouse Transaction System) and Korber (also referred to as "Corporate") are point-of-sale systems used by Safelite. WTS is an older system built on a PIC operating system that has been used since approximately 1991-1992. The system was originally called GTS before being redeveloped as WTS.

The field primarily accesses WTS through a browser, though some personnel use a thick client. The system has both production and development environments:

- Production: East Central (East Central 1 is typically the master, East Central 2 is the slave)
- Development/Testing: T Central (T Central 1 is always the master, never flipped to T Central 2)

## Access Methods

### Browser Access
- Users access via a URL, clicking on a "warehouse operations" icon
- This launches an Accuterm terminal emulator
- Users log in with a three-digit employee number and password
- Alternative URL allows users to select which warehouse to access

### Thick Client Access
- Some staff use an Accuterm 7 thick client
- Allows command line access for advanced functions
- Can run scripts and access database directly

## Visual Identification
- Production screens have a dark blue and yellow color scheme
- Development/testing screens use cyan or black and white

## System Architecture

- Each store location has its own data siloed in the system
- Individual shipment tables, purchase order tables, and inventory tables
- Load balanced with 4 virtual PIC machines running on the AIG server
- Master-slave configuration for redundancy

## Warehouse Identification
- All locations in WTS are 5-digit numbers
- System handles leading zeros automatically

## Menu System Navigation
- Arrow keys navigate the main menu
- Enter key selects highlighted option
- Escape key backs out of menus
- Numeric input + Enter can directly access menu options
- Function keys provide additional shortcuts (e.g., F4, F6)

## Key Functionalities

### Shipping Management
- Menu Option 1: Wholesale sales (mostly deprecated)
- Intercompany transfers: Shipments to other Safelite locations
- View open pending shipments
- Filter by shipment number or shipping location
- Warehouse-to-warehouse transfers via Glass Track
- Picking orders and preparing shipments

### Inventory Management
- Stocking tickets for receiving inventory
- Primary bin system with overflow capability
- Physical inventory menus and cycle count sheets
- Inventory adjustments and scrap/blend bin management
- Part information screens showing:
  - On-hand quantity
  - Reserved quantity
  - Quantity in picking process
  - Scrap/blend quantity
  - Available quantity
- Bin location maintenance (rack, row, level format)
- Inventory history tracking (up to 4 years of transactions)

### Purchase Order Management
- View purchase orders from vendors or other Safelite locations
- Receive inventory from vendors or other locations
- Return to vendor functionality

## Data Management

- ID system uses numeric identifiers (shipment numbers in 200,000-300,000 range)
- Data purged after 60 days to manage storage limitations
- No SQL-like transaction capabilities (no commit/rollback)
- System times out after 30 minutes of inactivity

## Integration Points

### Glass Track Integration
- Glass Track communicates with WTS via MQ messages
- Maintains rules to determine whether to send to WTS or Corporate/Korber
- Secondary warehouse processing for inventory not available at primary
- XML messaging keeps inventory levels near real-time

### EBS System Integration
- Nightly batch files sent to EBS, primarily closing data
- EBS sends daily update files to WTS between 1:00-2:00 AM
- Mainframe scheduler controls process running around 4:15 AM
- Format conversion from PIC relational database to fixed-format strings

## Location Conversion Process (WTS to Corporate)

- When locations convert from WTS to Corporate:
  - Main menu is reduced to lookup functionality only
  - System displays "converted to corporate" message on login
  - Glass Track updates routing rules to send data to Corporate instead of WTS
  - Only limited functions remain accessible

## Common Technical Issues

- Inventory file balance problems
- Users abandoning processes mid-stream causing record locks
- Session timeouts causing interruptions
- MQ connection issues
- Network problems affecting order processing

## Warehouse Data Structure

- Bins organized as rack/row/level (e.g., rack 2, bin 50, level 4)
- Primary bins assigned to specific parts
- Overflow bin management for additional inventory
- Bin restructuring tools available for warehouse reorganization

## Security

- Daily rolling password system
- Combination of date/time with mathematical calculation
- Different access levels for different user roles
