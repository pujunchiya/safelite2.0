Hereâ€™s the **extracted and cleaned Technical KT document** from this third meeting file you uploaded:  
(again, keeping it in the same format: **detailed technical information only**, **no pleasantries**, and **tables in JSON**.)

# Technical Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document - Part 3

## 1. GlassTrack Overview

**GlassTrack System Concepts:**

- **Pages:**
  - **WTS Pages** (left side, no K1 prefix) are for Warehouse Transfer System operations.
  - **K1/Corporate Pages** (right side, K1 prefix) are for Korber operations.
- **Supply Chain Complexity:**  
  Two supply chains (WTS and Korber) are run **in parallel**.
- **Dual Code Bases:**  
  Separate code bases for WTS functions and Korber (K1).

**Facility Selection:**
- Selecting different facility IDs (e.g., Sacramento `00222`, Columbus).
- Facilities determine available functionality (WTS vs. K1).

## 2. Buyout and Sourcing in GlassTrack

**WTS Buyout Screen Features:**
- Single screen for **Pending**, **Source**, and **Pending Receive**.
- Allows direct sourcing from other Distribution Centers (DC) or vendors.
- **Warehouse-to-Warehouse Transfers** are possible in WTS but **not in Korber**.

**Sourcing Workflow:**
- Select an item.
- Choose distribution center or vendor.
- Call vendor directly if required.
- Notify GlassTrack about manual purchases.

**Vendor Contact Issues:**
- Some vendor phone numbers may be incorrect.
- Data quality managed externally.

**Warehouse-to-Warehouse Transfers:**
- Available only in WTS.
- Special shipment provisioned separately.

**Network Classifications:**
```json
[
  {"Network": "In Network", "Definition": "Close geographical proximity"},
  {"Network": "Out of Network", "Definition": "Farther geographical area"}
]
```

## 3. Breakage and Inventory Adjustments

**Breakage Handling:**
- RF guns used to scan and update broken inventory.
- In corporate (K1), breakage can be logged manually.

---

## 4. GlassTrack Additional Features

**DC Sweep and DC One-Click:**
- **DC Sweep:** Source multiple orders at once to create a single flyer.
- **DC One-Click:** Legacy feature allowing faster sourcing if parts are readily available.

---

## 5. K1 (Korber) Specific Screens

**Buyout Sourcing:**
- Only two tabs:  
  1. Supporting Location
  2. Vendor
- No warehouse-to-warehouse transfer.
- Notes on parts heavily influence sourcing decisions.

**System Navigation:**
- **Managed Features** section in Administration helps identify K1 vs. WTS locations.
- K1 locations tagged as "HighJump" (legacy name for Korber).

---

## 6. Orders and Transfers

**Transfer Orders:**
- Transfers from warehouse to store.
- **Status Codes:**
  - New: Not picked yet.
  - Allocated: Assigned to picker.

**Reservation Requests:**
- Lookup reservations against due dates.

---

## 7. Administration Section

**Roles and Activities:**
- **Manage Features:** Switch facilities between WTS and Korber.
- **Manage Vendor Locations:** Add vendors to specific locations.
- **Manage Warehouse Restrictions:**  
  Set warehouse sourcing restrictions (WTS-specific).

**Other Admin Tools:**
- Auto-sourcing and Facility Imports are legacy features, not actively used.
- **Helpdesk Tools:** Clearing stale appointment dates, mostly automated now.

---

## 8. System Interactions and Responsibilities

**System Ownership Diagram:**
- **Green Boxes:** Full supply chain system ownership.
- **Blue Boxes:** Partial ownership (e.g., ESL, SV2).

**GlassTrack and Korber Interaction:**
- GlassTrack sends sourcing data to Korber.
- Mulesoft used for middleware communication (not XML except in specific cases).

**Common Troubleshooting Steps:**
```json
[
  {"Step": "Check GlassTrack if order is sourced properly."},
  {"Step": "Check Mulesoft for transmission issues."},
  {"Step": "Validate Korber for receiving issues."}
]
```

---

## 9. Typical Incidents and Triage Process

**Common Tickets:**
- Short shipments not appearing in GlassTrack.
- Unable to receive Purchase Orders (PO) in Korber.

**Sample Triage Steps for ASN Issues:**
```json
[
  {"Step": "Validate ASN exists in Korber."},
  {"Step": "If missing, check Mulesoft transmission."},
  {"Step": "If ASN is missing, receive using PO receipt manually."}
]
```

**Required Data for Ticket Analysis:**
```json
[
  "Warehouse ID",
  "Store Number",
  "ASN Number",
  "HUID (Host Unique ID)"
]
```

**Bill of Lading (BOL) Importance:**
- Requested to be attached to every ASN-related incident.

---

## 10. Ticket Handling Best Practices

**Triage Documentation:**
- Standardized templates under creation.
- Focus on top 20 common incidents.

**Investigation Process:**
- Step-by-step triage flow.
- Clear documentation linking symptoms, actions, systems involved, and solutions.

Would you like me to now **combine all three extracted KT documents into one final `.txt` file** and **the JSON tables separately** so you can **download everything cleanly**?
